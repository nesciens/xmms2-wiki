Info about the libao output plugin...

This is plugin tries to make full use of the limited libao api to provide a portable option for playing sound. Libao is basically a wrapper over other sound systems.  It currently supports alsa, esd, oss and irix,sun,aix sound systems etc. For more info look [http://www.xiph.org/libao here].

== Configuration ==
Libao uses a default driver that is specified in its configuration files (/etc/libao.conf for ''system-wide options'' and ~/.libao for ''personal options'').  The personal file take precedence over the system-wide files. Lines in these files take the form:

option=value

Supported options are :

default_driver - this specifes the driver that libao should use by default.

Acceptable values are
* null
* alsa - old alsa (dont use this.  i think you want the other one)
* alsa09 - new version of alsa 
* esd - ESound Daemon
* irix
* oss - Open Sound System
* sun
* aixs

The XMMS2 plugin does not currently support ''write to file'' plugins even though libao does.

== TODO ==

There are some comments in the code about what needs to be done.  This is somewhat of a summary of those comments.

It needs some work to fully utilize the libao api.  For example, the ao_driver_info() call could be used to obtain some kind of configuration information.
