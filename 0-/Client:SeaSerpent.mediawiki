Goal is to be a full-featured client.  Drag-and-drop, editing tags, display album art, queue, random play, shuffle playlist, search and find, save playlists and eq settings, and much more.  Please see http://inkleined.com/SeaSerpent for more info and features.  

UPDATE 2010-3-30: Fixed website download link, create a sourceforge page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/seaserpent/), and re-uploaded correct zipped file to all places.

UPDATE 2010-7-18: Released version 1.1.  New: much more powerful metadata editor, two color options: (1) deep purple SeaSerpent color or (2) your OS color scheme (mostly).  There are new screenshots and new documentation indicating how to use the metadata editor.
