{{Client |name=xmms2play| author=[[Alexander Botero-Lowry]]| website=Unknown| version=0.07| devlanguage=C| ui=GTK2| screenshots=N/A| description=xmms2play is a simple GTK2 xmms2 client written in C. It is designed for those that desire a minimalist design. It does not include a playlist, instead intending for external applications such as medialib-ui to be used for that purpose. xmms2play-0.07 includes more or less functional code for handling utf8 characters in song titles, it has also been updated for a bunch of small API changes in xmmsclient. xmms2play also now uses pkg-config instead of hardcoded CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. It can be downloaded from http://www.stampede.org/~drax/xmms2play-0.07.tar.gz Client written by [[Alexander Botero-Lowry]].}}
