You can submit code for inclusion into the main XMMS2 tree for various reasons:

* bug fixes
* new plugins or features
* cleanups, better documentation

The XMMS2 development team reserves the right to include or to exclude code at its own discretion.

== Requirements ==
In order to be considered for inclusion, your code should meet the following requirements:

* comply with the [[XMMS2 Coding Style]]
* be licensed under the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html LGPL]. (or under a [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses GPL-compatible] license?)
* does not violate the [[Design of XMMS2]] (e.g. some really dodgy hack to allow XMMS2 to play video.. somehow)

=== Suggestions ===

* Make sure that your code Works(tm) before submitting it, and that it doesn't introduce any major bugs (no bugs at all, would be preferred, of course ;).
* It could make it easier for us if you provide the necessary ''SConscript'' files to build your code, if needed. (or modify the ''SConstruct'', ''xmmsconf.py'' or ''xmmsenv.py'' files as needed - but ''please'' try not to break the existing build system)

== How to do it ==
[[About#Contact_info | Contact us]] either via the mailing list or on IRC. You may attach patches to e-mails, or publish the code on the web and provide a URL.
