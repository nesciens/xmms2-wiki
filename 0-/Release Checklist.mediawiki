This is a list of things that should probably be done or checked when doing a release.

* Version number set
* Release snapshot ready & uploaded to sourceforge
* Update freshmeat page
* Update debian packages
* wiki:
** news post [[Template:News]]
** release status box [[Template:ReleaseStatus]]
* doxygen + epydoc + rdoc docs generated & published to genesis (/exodus?)
* README in sync with 'Read me first!' wiki page
* INSTALL in sync with 'Installation instructions' wiki page
* AUTHORS in sync with contributors list on 'About' page?

Other things which currently would not really be possible:
* no release critical bugs? - criteria?
* pass build and runtime tests?
