This is a list of things that should be done or checked before, and when doing a release.

== Pre-release ==
* Create release page titled Release:<releasename>
** Categorise under [[:Category:Releases]] (<nowiki>[[Category:Releases]]</nowiki>)
* Make sure API-versions are increased if needed.
* Make sure so-versions are increased if needed.

== Release ==
* README in sync with 'Read me first!' wiki page
* INSTALL in sync with 'Installation instructions' wiki page
* Version number set
* Release snapshot ready (use release.py) & uploaded to sourceforge
* Update freshmeat page
* Send announcement to mailinglist
* wiki:
** news post [[Template:News]], [[Template:ShortNews]]
** release status box [[Template:ReleaseStatus]]
* doxygen + epydoc + rdoc docs generated & published to exodus
* Update [[History]] page

Other things which currently would not really be possible:
* no release critical bugs? - criteria?
* pass build and runtime tests?
