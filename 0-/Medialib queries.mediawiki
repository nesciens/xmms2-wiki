An example of what you might find in the property table for a medialib entry:
  sqlite> SELECT key, value FROM Property WHERE id=887; 
  resolved                |1
  musicbrainz_albumid     |e6253a2b-ddc9-442b-8c45-f6e0daf616e3
  musicbrainz_trmid       |482efcb5-0f7f-4eaf-98ab-8e1133507137
  samplerate              |44100
  duration                |276000
  musicbrainz_artistid    |9aec0d9a-c5b3-45ab-839c-d60f18534437

  tracknumber             |4
(Note that this data differs from entry to entry. However, there are some properties that usually are present in entries, like duration, bitrate, samplerate and resolved)


Select the five first entries from the Medialib, fetch duration from the Property table:
  sqlite> SELECT m.id, artist, album, title, p.value 
          FROM Media m, Property p 
          ON m.id=p.id AND p.key="duration" LIMIT 5;
