Should use all the same conventions as [[Generated IPC/Format | the Client-side prototype]].

=== Object/Signal/Broadcast Registration ===
Object initialization methods will call xmms_ipc_object_register(TYPE,OBJ) on the object structure, which contains function pointers to the various methods that the object wants to register. For example, xmms_playlist_t might be defined like:

 typedef struct _xmms_playlist_t {
         void (*clear)(_xmms_playlist_t *);
         char **(*list)(_xmms_playlist_t *);
         void (*playlist_updated)(_xmms_playlist_t *);
 } xmms_playlist_t;


Then, xmms_ipc_object_register(XMMS_IPC_OBJECT_PLAYLIST,playlist) is called after the playlist_init function fills in the function pointers. xmms_ipc_object_register then knows what functions are used for different IPC signals like XMMS_IPC_CMD_CLEAR and XMMS_IPC_SIGNAL_PLAYLIST_CHANGED. Instead of the playlist init code having to manually register the functions individually, it becomes one call to xmms_ipc_object_register() See [http://people.xmms2.org/~andersg/genipc/generated.c.txt] for a more complete struct example.
