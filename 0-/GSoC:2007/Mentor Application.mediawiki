# Describe your organization.
#* XMMS2 is the spiritual successor to the very successful project XMMS. The founders of XMMS got together in 2002 and spun out the sister project XMMS2 that is today lead by Tobias RundstrÃ¶m and Anders Gustafsson with around 10-15 regular contributors spread over the world (but concentrated in Europe). Our focus has been to separate music playback from the UI in order to provide multiple interfaces and other interesting features. While the code of the music playback engine is starting to mature we have also added features that is expected from modern music players like a Media library and a powerful way of querying it (Collections).
# Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2007? What do you hope to gain by participating?
#* We hope to gain (except beautiful code) more people involved in our project and more regular contributors. Our exposure in the program last year also gave our organization great PR that we hope to mimic this year.
# Did your organization participate in GSoC 2005 or 2006? If so, please summarize your involvement and the successes and failures of your student projects.
#* We participated for the first time 2006 and we feel that it was very successful but also that we have learned a lot. Last year we had two very successful project, two semi-successful and one failure. I think with the experience from last year we can turn those two semi-successful projects into successes. More preparation and a better understanding of the project will give us a advantage this year.
# If your organization has not previously participated in GSoC, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?

#* Alexander Botero-Lowry, alex.boterolowry@gmail.com
#* SÃ©bastien Cevey, theefer/gmail
# What criteria did you use to select these individuals as mentors? Please be as specific as possible.
#* Anders and Tobias was selected because they are the project leaders and also because they where mentoring last year. Alexander and Sebastien was involved as students last year and are now regular contributors to XMMS2, they have probably the best understanding of what is needed.
# What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?
#* Last year we had a disappearing student we realize now that there is no excuse for disappearing without explanation so we don't intend to show much mercy for people that dissapear. Bonus-URL on the subject: http://foucault.info/documents/disciplineAndPunish/foucault.disciplineAndPunish.torture.en.html
# What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?
#* Knowing the mentors very well we don't expect this to happen. Should it happen I will personally track down the offender and slap him into talk-ative mode.
# What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?
#* Hanging around on IRC will be a requirement, we will see non-IRCing as desertation. We will show our patented kindness and interest in the students work and persona. When we receive the SoC money for 2006 we probably will put a bit of that money into getting swag and bribe all students to stay with us this year.
# What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes?
#* See the above question.
