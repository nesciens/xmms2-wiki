|description=
The project will be split into two parts, generating the server code and the client code. The server side currently sets up the IPC file descriptor, reads/parses the raw IPC commands, and executes the commands in the server.
A high-level description of this functionality would be created and used to generate the code for this. The client side currently consists of an xmmsclient library that provides a high-level C interface to the XMMS IPC protocol, and is used as a 'glue layer' by the higher-level language bindings, such as perl and python. The work on this side would consist of defining a high-level description of the interface provided by xmmsc, generalizing it a bit, and then generating the C binding from this.
I will then need to test the C binding extensively for problems as the rest of the bindings depend on its correctness. I can then generate the perl, python, etc. bindings. The language I will be using for generating the code is Python.
