Also check leftovers from [[Summer of Code 2006/Proposed projects]]. And the long term wishlist in {{Bug|520}}.


{{SoCItem| title=[[Generated IPC | Auto-generated API and bindings]]| description=Currently, the C client library and the bindings (Python, Ruby, etc) have to be manually updated whenever a new function is introduced on the server. This work is tedious and mechanical, and the whole client API could in fact be automatically generated from a high-level description of the functions. The goal is therefore to determine the semantics of these descriptions (possibly using XML), and then use them to generate the different API source files.| lang=Python / XML| level=Advanced| mentor=[[User:Anders Gustafsson | Anders Gustafsson]]}}

{{SoCItem| title=Port Visualization to [[Transforms | transforms API]] and extend it to give PCM data| description=Currently visualization in XMMS2's devel branch is disabled with the transition to [[Transforms]]. This project would be to port visualization to the devel branch as a transform plugin and to extend it to give full PCM data.| lang=C| level=Medium to Advanced|mentor=[[User:Anders Gustafsson | Anders Gustafsson]]}}

{{SoCItem| title=Support for more formats/stream types| description=New formats can be supported by writing decoder modules for the server using our [[Transforms]] plugin interface, coupled with existing decoding libraries. Possible formats include, for instance:
* [http://zakalwe.virtuaalipalvelin.net/uade/ Amiga format] ([[List_of_features_required_for_proper_sub-tune_support|subtunes support]])
* [http://craz.net/programs/itunes/alac.html ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)]
* [http://www.last.fm Last.Fm]| lang=C| level=Medium to Advanced| mentor=''TBA''}}

* Service clients implementation and a specific service client (tag client?)
* Development on one of the more mature GUI clients (Esperanza, Insanity..)
* Multiple Output plugins (with flamesuit on)
* XMMS2Forge
* Interoperatibility (mpd-bridge, mepris, gstreamer)
* Test framework
* XMMS2-specific GUI toolkit widgets (gtk or qt)
* Exchangeable backend: other SQL databases or ad-hoc storage.
* Website reorganisation/redesign
* MTP transport {{Bug|1330}}
* Bindings (lua, lisp, others?) Might conflict with gen ipc..
