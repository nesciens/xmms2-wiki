Also check leftovers from [[Summer of Code 2006/Proposed projects]]. And the long term wishlist in {{Bug|520}}.

* Gen ipc
* Visualisations (pcm over shm)
* Support for more formats (shn, realaudio, usf, matroska, others?)
* Service clients implementation and a specific service client (tag client?)
* Development on one of the more mature GUI clients (Esperanza, Insanity..)
* Multiple Output plugins (with flamesuit on)
* XMMS2Forge
* Interoperatibility (mpd-bridge, mepris, gstreamer)
* Test framework
* XMMS2-specific GUI toolkit widgets (gtk or qt)
* Exchangeable backend: other SQL databases or ad-hoc storage.
* Website reorganisation/redesign
* MTP transport {{Bug|1330}}
* Bindings (lua, lisp, others?) Might conflict with gen ipc..
