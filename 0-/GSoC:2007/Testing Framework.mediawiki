XMMS2 has an extensive and diverse code base where the only kind of
testing done is ``it works for me'' testing. In the past attempts have
been made to create a testing framework but they have failed or lay
underdeveloped for a variety of reasons.

I believe that focusing on a language-agnostic model will make
developers more likely to implement tests since it won't require them to
write a test in a language that they are uncomfortable with or isn't
suited for that sort of test.
