== Cross Compiling the XMMS2+NMS with WAF ==

I'm taking the pre-DRJ xmms2 version, xmms-devel in git, and trying to cross compile it for the Neuros OSD.
It uses waf and there are problems.

First off, we need to use the arm-linux-* tools to test and build, so for the configure phase I export

  CXX="arm-linux-g++" CC="arm-linux-gcc" AR="arm-linux-ar" CPP="arm-linux-cpp" RANLIB="arm-linux-ranlib"

This works fine for all tools, since they find their way into the waf cache and waf uses them during the build process.
