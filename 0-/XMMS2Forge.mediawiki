== Scope and purpose ==
XMMS2Forge is a service to be provided for developers developing XMMS2 clients,
XMMS2-related tools (for example, covert art managers, etc) or
other XMMS2-related projects. XMMS2Forge is not for the hosting of general
purpose projects.

== Services ==
XMMS2Forge will offer the following services:
* A git repository, viewable and accessible via git.xmms2.org
* Limited user accounts and groups on xmms2.xmms2.org (restricted to git-shell)
* Project access on the XMMS2 bug tracker: bugs.xmms2.org
* [Optional?] mailing list
* [Optional?] Hosting of small web site about project

== Responsibilities ==
TODO

== Tools ==
TODO

<anders>	Maybe we should start with just a simple script that adds git-only useraccount and sets up a tree correctly. And if that tree has a website/ directory it is automatically checked out into /var/www/xmms2forge/<projectname>   or something..

<anders>	Oh, and adds a project to mantis and makes the user admin for that project too.

== Notes ==
* User account creation and git repo creation need to be separate: same user
* can belong to multiple projects (and have multiple repos).
