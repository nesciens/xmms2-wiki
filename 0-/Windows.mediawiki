== Prebuilt Binaries ==
The easiest way to get right into using XMMS2 on Windows is to download precompiled binaries.

* http://xmms2.xmms.se/~puzzles/win32/ (With Ruby, Python, and C++ bindings, plus the [[Client:Esperanza|Esperanza]] client)
* http://www.schrijnen.nl/auke/ (With [[Client:Esperanza|Esperanza]] built for win32)

== Building from Source ==
Want to roll your own XMMS2 for Windows? [[Windows/Mingw|Compile on Mingw]]!

Here is a [http://exodus.xmms.se/~tru/screens/esperanza/0.2/win32.png screenshot] of a real client running on Windows.

Development files can be found [http://exodus.xmms.se/~puzzles/win32/ here].

XMMS2 actually works very well on Windows now. The only quirks are the need for a patched GLib, a few broken plugins, and no startup.d/shutdown.d. Most of the Windows work is contained in xmms2-puzzles (which compiles smoothly out-of-the box), and is awaiting the merge into xmms2-devel after the [[Release:DrJekyll|DrJekyll]] release.
