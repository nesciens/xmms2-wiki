Some infos about the [[Windows/Mingw|Mingw compilation]]

Here is a [http://exodus.xmms.se/~tru/screens/esperanza/0.2/win32.png screenshot] of a real client running on Windows.

Development files can be found [http://exodus.xmms.se/~nano/clientlib-win32.tar.gz here].

xmms2 actually works pretty well on Windows now. The server works with very minor bugs and the clientlib seems to work without issues. There are still some patches that must be merged before it can be compiled out-of-the-box but we're getting there.
