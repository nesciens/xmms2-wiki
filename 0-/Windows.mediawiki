Status:
* xmmsclient working
* xmmsclient-glib working
* xmmsclient-python working
* xmms2 cli working
* xmms2d not working

There are some minor compiling issues preventing xmms2d from compiling, however, main.c must be replaced with a windows specific version which does something good<tm>. An output plugin must also be written, there is a non-tested version somewhere in the [http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se BTS] to start from, must at least be updated to the current API to get working.

You can get a precompiled DrBombay+WiP of the working parts [http://exodus.xmms.se/~nano/test.zip here].
