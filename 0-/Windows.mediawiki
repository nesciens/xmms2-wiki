== Prebuilt Binaries ==
The easiest way to get right into using XMMS2 on Windows is to download precompiled binaries.

== Building from Source ==
Want to roll your own XMMS2 for Windows? [[Windows/Mingw|Compile on Mingw]]!

Here is a [http://exodus.xmms.se/~tru/screens/esperanza/0.2/win32.png screenshot] of a real client running on Windows.

Development files can be found [http://exodus.xmms.se/~puzzles/win32/ here].

XMMS2 actually works very well on Windows now. The only quirks are the need for a patched GLib and a few broken plugins. Most of the Windows work is contained in the Playground branch of xmms2-puzzles (which compiles smoothly out-of-the box), and is awaiting the merge into xmms2-devel.
