Atm we use almost all playback/playlist/medialib -functions from xmms2, next version will support a first set of [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/X4X_Plugins plugins] as well as random playback. Futureplans are to extend X4X with other backends, maybe even video-support, etc.. We were also the authors of the [[Component:Java_bindings|javabindings]] which are in xmms2 since DrDolittle. Check out [http://x4x.sourceforge.net the projectpage on sf.net] for latest info's. Checkout v0.2 aka Anja from sourceforge' download page and visit us in #x4x on [irc://irc.freenode.net].

Ebuilds are available at [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Ebuilds].

You can test [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/webstart/x4x.jnlp x4x] directly via [http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/ java webstart] if you have already xmms2-DrEvil[rc] installed and your system is linux, others will follow.
