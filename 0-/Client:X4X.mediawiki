{{Client |name=X4X| author=[[dangertools|Georg Schild]]| website=http://x4x.sourceforge.net| version=[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=152896 0.3.4]| devlanguage=[http://java.sun.com java]| ui=[http://crosswidgets.sourceforge.net XWidgets]| screenshots=[http://sourceforge.net/dbimage.php?id=109894 1 (SWT)] - [http://sourceforge.net/dbimage.php?id=109890 2 (Qt Jambi)] - [http://sourceforge.net/dbimage.php?id=109892 3 (Swing)] |description=X4X is an almost complete client written in java using [http://crosswidgets.sourceforge.net XWidgets] as UI. Atm we use almost all playback/playlist/medialib -functions from xmms2, since 0.2 a first set of [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/X4X_Plugins plugins] as well as random playback is also supported.
X4X can integrate itself into kde (qt), gtk (swt), native (qt and swt) and not native (swing) environments using XWidgets.

X4X finally works fine on Microsoft Windows. Get x4x-win32-full-*.zip from the downloadpage

<font color="red">Development of X4X is stopped, use other nice clients instead</font>


==What makes X4X better then the rest==

* Fast and nice gui, all basic functionality in one window ([http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=152896 screenies])
* Treebrowser for various sources (file://, smb://, daap://, cdda://)
* Playlistmanagement
* Random playback
* Equalizer
* [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Shortcuts Keybindings] for almost everything
* Connection-browser (incl. optional mdns support) '''or''' autostart xmms2d (if the user wants)
* Systemtray
* -noX start option - doesn't open the mainwindow if a systemtray is present
* Ability to change xmms2's settings
* Due to XWidgets X4X has the ability to integrate into every environment (See screenshots)
* Support plugins (UI, Output)
* Runs on windows (and everywhere else where java6 and swig are available)
* Also works with '''[http://www.musicpd.org mpd]''', the music player daemon

* Apache Ant >=1.6
* Xmms2 DrJekyll or -devel right before DrJekyll
