Atm we use almost all playback/playlist/medialib -functions from xmms2, since 0.2 a first set of [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/X4X_Plugins plugins] as well as random playback is also supported.
X4X can integrate itself into kde (qt), gtk (swt), native (qt and swt) and not native (swing) environments using XWidgets.


==What makes X4X better then the rest==

* Fast and nice gui, all basic functionality in one window ([http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=152896 screenies])
* Treebrowser for various sources (file://, smb://, daap://)
* Playlistmanagement
* Random playback
* Equalizer
* [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Shortcuts Keybindings] for almost everything
* Connection-browser (incl. optional mdns support)
* Systemtray
* -noX start option - doesn't open the mainwindow if a systemtray is present
* Ability to change xmms2's settings
* Due to XWidgets X4X has the ability to integrate into every environment (See screenshots)
* Support plugins (UI, Output)
* Runs on windows (and everywhere else where java6 and swig are available)
* Also works with '''[http://www.musicpd.org mpd]''', the music player daemon

==Dependencies==

* JDK6 (get one from [http://java.sun.com])
* Apache Ant >=1.6
* Xmms2 DrJekyll or -devel right before DrJekyll
* SWIG >=1.3.25 (from [http://www.swig.org])
* XWidgets 0.1 (from [http://crosswidgets.sourceforge.net] or get the Swing-only binary package from our [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=152896 downloadpage] - Note that this Version of XWidgets only contains the Swing code, nothing else
* JmDNS 0.1 for '''optional''' mdns support
