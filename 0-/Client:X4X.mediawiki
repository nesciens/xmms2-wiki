Atm we use almost all playback/playlist/medialib -functions from xmms2, since 0.2 a first set of [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/X4X_Plugins plugins] as well as random playback is also supported.
Check out http://x4x.sourceforge.net for latest info's and visit us in #x4x on [irc://irc.freenode.net].

Ebuilds are available at [http://x4x.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Ebuilds].

'''At the moment X4X is in heavy development (again) since XWidgets are moving on to 0.1, the 4th screeny already shows some changes. Besides that the collections integration as well as support for mpd is being integrated soon (>0.3).'''}}
