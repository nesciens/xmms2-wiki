{{Navbar}}

Trying to be quite frequent bug reporter and patch sender, very much interested in the modular design of XMMS2. Maintainer of the AAC/MP4 plugin using faad2 library introduced in DR3. Also trying to clean up the ices plugin to be usable again, a project which progresses quite well.

Author of never finished and not updated [http://xmms-oggcaster.sf.net/ XMMS OggCaster] plugin. (got little frustrated due to the inflexible XMMS1 design and forced use of GTK 1.x)
