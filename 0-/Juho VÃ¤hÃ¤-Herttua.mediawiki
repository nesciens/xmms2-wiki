Trying to be quite frequent bug reporter and patch sender, very much interested in the modular design of XMMS2. Author and maintainer of the AAC/MP4 plugin using faad2 library introduced in DR3, the ASF/WMA plugin using ffmpeg library and new equalizer plugin ported from EQU project introduced in DrEvil, the phase vocoder plugin and libao output plugin introduced in DrHouse. I've also done the porting of XMMS2 to Solaris and helped with some win32 porting related stuff.

Author of never finished and not updated [http://xmms-oggcaster.sf.net/ XMMS OggCaster] plugin. (got little frustrated due to the inflexible XMMS1 design and forced use of GTK 1.x)
