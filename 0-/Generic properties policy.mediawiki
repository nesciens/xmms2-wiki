This page tries to list all properties that different clients write into the medialib and that can be useful for other clients too.

Should be written to source "client/generic"

* rank - value from 0-99 where 99 is best
* comment - a searchable comment
* tag - comma seperated tags. tags could be "anything"

Proposed Album Art, source = client/generic/arturl and client/generic/arturl_unverified

* album_front_large - front of album - at least 320x320
* album_front_small - front of album - at least 140x140 - 160x160 is usually amazons standard size, the standard ``small size`` for itunes music store is 170x170 This is '''Required'''.
* album_front_thumbnail - front of album - 100x100, only 100x100

* album_back_large - back of album - at least 320x320
* album_back_small - back of album - at least 140x140 - 160x160 is usually amazons standard size, the standard ``small size`` for itunes music store is 170x170
* album_back_thumbnail - back of album - 100x100, only 100x100

All values should give a url to the album cover. A client that fetches album art should be sure to try to fill in missing art. For example if a client gathers a Large image it should create scaled images to fill in the small and thumbnail sizes. These should be stored locally in ~/.xmms2/clients/generic/art . Clients should NOT scale up. so if you have a small only (the case for amazon) the client should scale down a thumbnail, but not scale up a large. 

Any art that a client ``guesses`` should be put into arturl_unverified first until a verifier client moves them over to client/generic/arturl. This way we can make educated guesses in the background and then the user can verify them as time permits. 

Clients should use client/generic/arturl, but may use client/generic/arturl_unverified if they denote that the art is unverified. 

Potentially there are other things, like inlay, cd, etc if you think they should be added, discuss in [[Talk:Generic properties policy|Talk page]] or on the mailinglist.
