Any art that a client ``guesses`` should be put into arturl_unverified first until a verifier client moves them over to client/generic/arturl. This way we can make educated guesses in the background and then the user can verify them as time permits. 

Clients should use client/generic/arturl, but may use client/generic/arturl_unverified if they denote that the art is unverified. 

Potentially there are other things, like inlay, cd, etc if you think they should be added, discuss in [[Talk:Generic properties policy|Talk page]] or on the mailinglist.
