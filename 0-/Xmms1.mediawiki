do we _really_ want to keep this plugin around in xmms anylonger? sure, it's a simple demo plugin, but.. really.. we should nuke it :) This is one of those headaches we shouldn't bother with (nowadays)

:I think that most of the problems with the GL plugin relates to people that have shot themselves in the foot, often by using the wrong version of libGL.  On the other hand, I wouldn't be sad to see the GL plugin go.  It would be nice to pacage it separately if we do though. - havardk

== time bug(s) ==
this ought to be sorted out, which are mad plugins, which are caused by the "old" time bug that's bee around in the cvs since _after_ the release of 1.2.10 (you know the one you fixed the other day)

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2067 2067] '''PATCH''' frame size assumption by xmms (could this be related to bug [http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=989 989]?)

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305 305] '''PATCH'''
Reads playlist song title entries from .pls files

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=333 333] '''PATCH'''
Ignore missing files when skipping backwards. Current behavior is if song a exists, b is missing and c is playing. Press back and xmms jumps to b, finds it missing and jumps forward to c again. Patch alters this to allow the user to skip from c to a by pressing back

* This thing just almost works, buggy wrt to cdaudio files.  Not 1.2.11 material.

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=909 909] '''PATCH'''
Uses the xfont in the minimized playlist. Not sure if we should apply this or not, as the minimized playlist has very limited space. However, this might just aswell be up to the user.

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1389 1389]
We save CDDB queries in ~/.xmms/cdinfo instead of "standard" ~/.cddb/[ID]

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=969 969] '''PATCH'''
Having title data enabled while streaming through proxy removes headers and as such causes bleeps and blops

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1972 1972] When streaming files we should honour the header for filename instead of the url? I'm torn...

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=296 296] '''PATCH''' Seek in streams, olden golden

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2194 2194] Allow overriding user agent for http streaming, should be trivial enough, and we already allow something simmilar for the CDDB query

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1293 1293] GET http request doesn't follow RFC 1945

[http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1538 1538] xmms /dev/ hangs :) and play location aswell
