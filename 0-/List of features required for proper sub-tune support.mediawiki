This matter has moderate level of complexity due to differences in formats having sub-tunes. SID-tunes are rather simple, the file header defines number of sub-tunes, thus it is known without running any emulated code. Some special custom module playing routines (supported by UADE) are more problematic, they _may_ require undefined length of execution of the actual emulation to determine the number of sub-tunes. Thus I have come up with two slightly distinct ways to implement good support for sub-tunes, and I suggest following:

== Similar in both methods ==

* There should be a way to query number of available sub-tunes from decoder plugin. The decoder could return number of tunes IF KNOWN, or some special values if the number is known only after execution (not feasible to detect while adding files to playlist)

== Method #1 ==

* Based on above information, the core should add to playlist the sub-tunes (IF KNOWN) 

== Method #2 ==

*
