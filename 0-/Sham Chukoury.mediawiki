What I do on XMMS2:

* Keep the wiki nice and up to date, with spiffy templates, categories and sometimes colours
* Fiddle with Doxygen & XML to try and produce nicer documentation about XMMS2
* Be a spelling & grammar nazi, and proofread just about anything XMMS2-related
* Play with Python bindings
* Write python-based [[XMMS2 Clients]]
* Fix simple bugs when I can
