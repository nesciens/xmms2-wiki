= Overview =
XMMS2 uses a flexible plugin concept called transforms (main article: [[Transforms]]). Each transform does some work to help decode the input. Transform plugins are assembled into a chain at runtime to decode each song bit-by-bit.

Transform plugins (xforms) can be categorized into the following types (and possibly more): playlists, transports, demuxers, metadata, decoders, effects, outputs, special, and others.

= Plugins =
== Playlists ==
Playlist xforms parse and load playlist files.

* [[Component:cue|cue]]
* [[Component:HTML|HTML]]
* [[Component:m3u|m3u]]
* [[Component:pls|pls]]
* [[Component:RSS|RSS]]
* [[Component:XSPF|XSPF]]

== Transports ==
Transports get raw data as a stream from a source such as a hard disk or internet radio.

* [[Component:CDDA|CDDA]]
* [[Component:cURL|cURL]]
* [[Component:DAAP|DAAP]]
* [[Component:file|file]]
* [[Component:gnomevfs|gnomevfs]]
* [[Component:lastfm|lastfm]]
* [[Component:mms|mms]]
* [[Component:samba|samba]]

== Demuxers ==
Demuxers (short for "demultiplexers") strip away container formats and pass on any relevant information from the container.

* [[Component:avformat|avformat]]

== Metadata ==
Metadata xforms strip out metadata like ID3 tags and vorbis comments from streams.

* [[Component:icymetaint|icymetaint]]
* [[Component:ID3v2|ID3v2]]
* [[Component:lastfmeta|lastfmeta]]
* [[Component:ofa|ofa]]

== Decoders ==
Decoders turn the encoded audio data into raw audio data that can be used by effects and outputs.

* [[Component:avcodec|avcodec]]
* [[Component:FAAD|FAAD]]
* [[Component:FLAC|FLAC]]
* [[Component:mac|mac]]
* [[Component:mad|mad]]
* [[Component:modplug|modplug]]
* [[Component:mp4|mp4]]
* [[Component:musepack|musepack]]
* [[Component:sid|sid]]
* [[Component:speex|speex]]
* [[Component:vorbis|vorbis]]
* [[Component:wave|wave]]

== Effects ==
Effects modify the raw audio data before it is sent to the output.

* [[Component:equalizer|equalizer]]
* [[Component:replaygain|replaygain]]
* [[Component:vocoder|vocoder]]

== Outputs ==
Outputs send the raw audio data out, usually to speakers, but also as internet radio streams or to the harddrive.

* [[Component:ALSA|ALSA]]
* [[Component:ao|ao]]
* [[Component:coreaudio|coreaudio]]
* [[Component:diskwrite|diskwrite]]
* [[Component:ices|ices]]
* [[Component:jack|jack]]
* [[Component:nms|nms]]
* [[Component:null|null]]
* [[Component:OSS|OSS]]
* [[Component:sun|sun]]
* [[Component:waveout|waveout]]

== Special ==
Special xforms are built into XMMS2 and required for operation. They act as glue between certain xforms.

* [[Component:converter|converter]]
* [[Component:magic|magic]]
* [[Component:ringbuf|ringbuf]]

== Others ==
These xforms don't fit in well in the other categories. Usually these are used to help other xforms and have little use on their own.

* [[Component:nulstripper|nulstripper]] - Removes null bytes (not audio) at the beginning of streams. This helps the magic xform.
* [[Component:XML|XML]] - Used as a helper for XML-based playlist xforms (like RSS and XSPF).
