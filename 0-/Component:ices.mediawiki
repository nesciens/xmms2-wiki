[icecast.org icecast] is a GPL streaming media server project that currently streams in MP3 format, with plans to add support for video and Vorbis formats.

[[XMMS]] had an icecast effect plugin with which you could broadcast your xmms music to an icecast server.

It's not possible to use [[XMMS]] plugins with XMMS2, but a similar plugin is planned for XMMS2.
