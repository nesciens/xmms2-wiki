==Introduction==
TurboX2 is one of the more advanced XMMS2 clients around. It has a lot of nice features and an interesting, interface with which to work. TurboX2 has suffered a bit of neglect, and could really use some love to get
it up to release quality. The goal of this Summer of Code project more abstractly is to make a stable release
that can be used without much issue on a number of web browsers and with an ease of installation that a moderately competent user could install and use it. 

==Todo==
:&#10063; Finish JavaScript implementation of PropDict and use it through out TurboX2 
:&#10063; Make TurboX2 at least work on Safari and hopefully on Opera and IE 6
:&#10063; Playlist Optimisation - general optimistation for large lists of data 
:&#10063; General cleanup and refactoring - object orientation for the javascript and python is a plus
:&#10063; Get a working implementation of Views with at least a View that mimics the current artist-album view
:&#10063; Get things working with python's distutils so that TurboX2 can be redistriubted
