== ChangeLog ==
* Tobias RundstrÃ¶m <tru@xmms.org>
** Fixed a bug that generated wrong contents of the pkg-config files.
** Fixed a bug where ringbuffer was created with size 0 if there was no configfile available.
** Fix bug #173, shuffle problems with playlist
** Fix bug #179, don't move entries outside the playlist.
** Start buffer the transport when waiting for the mimetype in import_playlist.
** Remove order clause in views. Added upgrade schemas, this means if you upgrade from v11 to v12 this will not destroy your medialib.
** Changed EnsureSCons version 0.96 since we seem to have problems with 0.95
**    Don't start daemon if the plugin directory is unreadable.
**    Initialize playlist and plugins in the right order. Could cause memory violation in rare cases.
**    OSS plugin: Handle if open() returns --1.
**    CLI: added mlib addall command for adding all files in medialib to the playlist
**    CLI: changed key=value to key like value. To support wildcards in search.
**    CLI: fixed a bug with searchadd that didn't check input correctly.
**    CLI: Make searches non-case sensetive
* Anders Gustafsson <andersg@xmms.org>
**    Simplify m3u and pls plugins.
***      Introduce a xmms_transport_read_line which reads one line from the transport. Make m3u and pls plugins use it.
**    Avoid race by reffing transport before starting transport thread.
**    Hold write_mutex while flushing, so its serialized wrt writes.
**    Flush call moved from xmms_decoder_seek to xmms_output_seek.
**    Remove seek-glitch.
**    Move flush-on-stop call to output.c
**    Use an own lock for serializing calls into plugin, instead of abusing write_lock.
**    OSS: Remove mutex in oss, serialized at higher level now.
**    OSS: Fix rates in oss plugins. (11025, not 12025)
**    ALSA: Handle error from snd_pcm_avail_update in alsa.c
**    ALSA: Make default alsamixer "default" not "hw:0"
**    ALSA: Fix rates in alsa plugins. (11025, not 12025)
**    ALSA: Don't change volume in open in alsa.c.
** BUG 180: Fix xmms_medialib_select to handle %s in query
* Tilman Sauerbeck <tilman@code-monkey.de>
**    Ruby bindings: added a bunch of methods to XmmsClient (bug #171).
**    Ruby bindings: Removed XmmsClient#disconnect.
**    Ruby bindings: Added XmmsClient#delete!
**    Ruby bindings: exported some IO functions.
**    Ruby bindings: Initialize XmmsClient's 'deleted' flag.
**    Ruby bindings: Use StringValue() to check for strings instead of Check_Type().
**    Ruby bindings: Fixed bug #185. Need to rb_require 'glib2' instead of 'glib'.
**    CLI: remove doesn't accept invalid ids anymore.
**    ALSA: Use longs instead of ints to store volume in ALSA since that's what ALSA uses internally.
**    CLIENTLIB: Remove xmmsc_disconnect() declaration from xmmsclient.h since the function has been long removed.
**    Bug #177, PlaylistEntries has entry as unique - won't allow more then one of the same entry in the playlist
**    When we remove an entry from the playlist, 'currentpos' needs to be decreased if the current entry has been removed.
