mDNS is also known as [[Wikipedia:Zeroconf|zeroconf]], [http://developer.apple.com/networking/bonjour/ bonjour] and so on. This makes XMMS2 announce it's availablity via the mDNS protocol. Currently there are two different implementations in XMMS2. One for the [http://www.avahi.org avahi] library and the other for MacOSX's DNS_SD library. Waf will build the one that you have installed.

Clients should implement mDNS lookup by looking up _xmms2._tcp service. An example is in the [[Client:Promoe]] or [[Client:Esperanza]] ServerBrowser.
