==How to use samba==
*edit your smb.conf and add :
   security = share
   guest only = yes
in the golbal section
BE CAREFUL...THAT WILL ALLOW EVERYONE TO BROWSE YOUR SHARES...Mabe there is another way but as a simple user(i'm not a xmms2 developer) i don't know how to use username and passwords,i tried setting the environment variable but that didn't work

*then in url is:
 smb://YourMachine/Yourshare
for instance with the command line client you can add it typing the following:
 xmms2 radd smb://192.168.1.111/music

You could also use a password-protected share and use the url smb://YourUserName:YourPassword@YourMachine/Yourshare
