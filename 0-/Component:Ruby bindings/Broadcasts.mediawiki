== broadcast_config_value_changed ==

Some configuration variable changed.

* '''res''' is a hash of key-value pairs. Key is a configuration variable name, while value isâ€¦ well, it's value. Sample code:

<pre>
xmms.broadcast_config_value_changed.notifier do |res|
    res.each_pair do |key, value|
        puts "#{key} = #{value}"
    end
end
</pre>

'''Note''': in v.0.6 and v.0.7 key is a symbol. It is a bug. Use key.to_s to get key's name.
