I think there should be a meeting soon, to clear up some issues.

Points for discussion:
* Can we make anders' life easier?
* Chaos with rvsplit-repositories
** Is it possible to create a separate repository/branch for things like this?
*** which appears separately on g.x.s/merge/
*** which never gets rebased
*** which eventually get merged/rebased with devel (with/without history-rewrite?)
* merge procedure
** For large stuff: rebase or merge?
*** For example coll2 will be painful to rebase onto rvsplit, as a lot of xmmsc_coll has been changed to xmmsv_coll, which means conflict in every other commit. Merge might be less painful if such renaming is done in some pre-merge commit. Also functions need to be updated to rvsplit. Should this be in every patch where such a change is needed, or is one patch after the rebase ok?
* DrM 
** content (bug fixes, rvsplit, sc, nycli, coll2?)
* time line
** rvsplit
** sc
** nycli
** coll2
** DrM
* coll2 remaining issues (more feedback (see ML))
* There are lots of small bugs. How do we go about them? Can you just push them if you /think/ they're sane?
* Buildbot
** Who has fixing power? (Maybe someone other that anders can get is out of its cupboard, to get the config?)
** Possible to provide binaries in the long run?
* Who has the power to change the merge-page? is its source available, so that patches can be submitted?
** Annoying typo: "UNKONWN AUTHOR"
** Maybe some "this commit is not in devel but in n dev repositories"-section?
* FOSDEM'09
** Is there news?
* SkitIDet
** karma?
* Planet
** A number of feed links are broken
** Is source available, so that patches can be submitted?
** Who has editing power?
