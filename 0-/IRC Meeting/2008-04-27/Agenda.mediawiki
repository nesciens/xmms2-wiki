* Check-ups:
** [[Component:Visualization|Visualization]] ([[User:ypnos|FoPref]], [[User:Anders Gustafsson|anders]])
** <mantis>1927</mantis> - merged yet? ([[User:rafl|rafl]])
* Collections 2.0 - Source preference:
** Should collections only use the preferred sources for querying. If so, what happens when multiple sources have the same priority?
** If the previous question is answered positively: should source-preference be connection specific, or globally in the server.
** Should collections maybe consider all sources in the querying, but have the possibility to only return the top-most sources to the user?
