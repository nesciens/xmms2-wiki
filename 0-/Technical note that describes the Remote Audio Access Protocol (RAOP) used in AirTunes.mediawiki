== Overview ==

This technical note describes the Remote Audio Access Protocol (RAOP) as used in Apple 
iTunes to stream music to the Airport Express (ApEx). Although RAOP is not documented, 
it is quite simple to analyze. RAOP is based on the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) 
but with an extra challenge-response based authentication step. The description of RAOP 
here is partly based on previous reverse-engineering efforts [1, 2, 3]. I also independently<br> 
analyzed RAOP by analyzing the network packets exchanged observed between an iTunes client<br> 
(v6.0.4) and ApEx (firmware v6.3). Please note that my understanding of the authentication<br> 
step differs from [2] and is based on packet analysis and [3].

== ApEx Discovery ==

ApEx and iTunes discover each other by using the Multicast DNS (MDNS)/Service Discovery protocol<br> 
from the Bonjour protocol suite. This is a very simple exchange involving the respective MDNS<br> 
TXT service records of ApEx and iTunes services.<br>

----
== RAOP ==

RAOP uses two channels for streaming music: a control channel which uses RTSP and a data<br> 
channel for sending the raw data. Upon startup, iTunes initiates a RTSP connection to the<br> 
Airport on port 5000. This exchange is shown below (Traffic from iTunes to ApEx is in Blue<br> 
and the reverse direction is in Red):

As can be seen the iTunes client provides its version number and a randomly generated 22-byte<br> 
cryptographic â€œchallengeâ€œ to the ApEx in the Apple-Challenge parameter. The ApEx replies with a<br> 
response (Apple-Response) which is the challenge encrypted using the private key stored in the ApEx.<br>
iTunes verifies this value using its public key part of the assymmetric key-pair. Note that this<br> 
step is performed by iTunes to verify if it is talking to a real ApEx. The connection is tore down<br> 
after this exchange.<br>

iTunes then establishes another RTSP connection to ApEx on the same port (5000) wherein it provides<br> 
a randomly generated AES key (rsaaeskey) with an Initialization Vector (aesiv) to the ApEx. The AES<br> 
key is encrypted using the public key by iTunes. The ApEx verifies that it is talking to iTunes by<br> 
decrypting the AES key using its private key. Note that the public key part has been recovered using<br> 
reverse-engineering and is publicly available [3]. This exchange is shown below:<br>

Next, the ApEx tells iTunes which port to use for the data connection (server_port, typically 6000):
