=== Notes to client authors ===

=== Notes to xform authors ===

* The methods xmms_xform_metadata_get_int/str now get value by reference and returns a boolean indicating if the datum did exist.
* The xmms_config_property_callback_remove method now expects a userdata arg, so the same callback as added with xmms_config_property_callback_set is removed.
