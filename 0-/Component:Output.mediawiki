The Output component is the one that "drives" XMMS2. It takes a playlist entry from the [[Component:Playlist | playlist]] and starts the [[Component:Transport | transport]] and the [[Component:Decoder | decoder]] for that entry. The output then reads from the decoders and outputs the decoded data (usually) to the soundcard.

The real output is done via a selected [[Category:Output Plugins | Output Plugin]].
