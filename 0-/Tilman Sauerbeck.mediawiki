My xmms2 related work:
* xmmsclient-ecore
* Euphoria, a graphical xmms2 client based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). The code in the Enlightenment CVS repository is *ancient*, don't try to build it - instead, use this snapshot: http://code-monkey.de/files/euphoria-snap.tar.bz2 until the current codebase is available in CVS again.
* Ruby bindings for xmmsclient
* an experimental audioscrobbler client (not published yet ;p)

There's probably more information at my website, http://code-monkey.de
