My xmms2-related work:
* xmmsclient-ecore
* Euphoria, a graphical xmms2 client based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). Find it in the Enlightenment CVS repository.
* Ruby bindings for xmmsclient
* [[Client:XMMS2-Scrobbler | XMMS2-Scrobbler]], an Audioscrobbler/last.fm client

Misc. clients/scripts:
* [http://exodus.xmms.se/~tilman/playlist-import.rb playlist-import.rb] imports playlists from an old medialib.db
* [http://exodus.xmms.se/~tilman/punch.rb punch.rb] adds a song to the playlist and queues it as the next song to play
* Maybe more in http://exodus.xmms.se/~tilman

There's probably more information at my website, http://code-monkey.de
