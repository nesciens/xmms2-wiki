My xmms2 related work:
* xmmsclient-ecore
* Euphoria, a graphical xmms2 client based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). Get it from the Enlightenment CVS repository.
* Ruby bindings for xmmsclient
* an experimental audioscrobbler client (not published yet ;p)

There's probably more information at my website, http://code-monkey.de
