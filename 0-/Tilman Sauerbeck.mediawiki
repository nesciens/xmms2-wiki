My xmms2 related work:
* xmmsclient-ecore
* Euphoria, a graphical xmms2 client based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). The code in the Enlightenment CVS repository is *ancient*, don't try to build it - instead, use a snapshot from http://code-monkey.de/files/ until the current codebase is available in CVS again.
* Ruby bindings for xmmsclient
* xmms2-scrobbler, an Audioscrobbler client currently in testing: http://code-monkey.de/projects/xmms2-scrobbler.html

There's probably more information at my website, http://code-monkey.de
