My xmms2-related work:
* xmmsclient-ecore
* Euphoria, a graphical xmms2 client based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). Find it in the Enlightenment CVS repository.
* Ruby bindings for xmmsclient
* xmms2-scrobbler, an Audioscrobbler client currently in testing: http://code-monkey.de/projects/xmms2-scrobbler.html

Misc. clients/scripts:
* [http://exodus.xmms.se/~tilman/playlist-import.rb playlist-import.rb] imports playlists from an old medialib.db
* [http://exodus.xmms.se/~tilman/punch.rb punch.rb] adds a song to the playlist and queues it as the next song to play

There's probably more information at my website, http://code-monkey.de
