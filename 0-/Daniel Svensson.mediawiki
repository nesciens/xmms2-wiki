Contributing with strange ideas, finding silly bugs, alsa output, smb transport and some small hacks here and there while listening to odd music and watching Star Trek. Lives in Lund/Scania/Sweden.

Private stashbag includes .NET-bindings (only tested with mono). Will be public when I'm satisfied. A GTK# client is under development, mostly for testing I think.
