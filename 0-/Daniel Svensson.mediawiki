Started using XMMS2 back in 2003 when contributing the [http://git.xmms2.org/xmms2/xmms2-devel/log/src/plugins/alsa/alsa.c ALSA output plugin]. Some minor fixes here and there while listening to [http://www.last.fm/user/dsvensson/ odd music] and watching Star Trek/Gate/whatever. Seems to study something at the University of Lund/Scania/Sweden. Can be contacted at the xmms2 irc channel under the nick 'nano' or by gmail: dsvensson
