== Try it ==
# '''Install XMMS2 v0.7.''' On Archlinux, you'd simply run `sudo pacman -S xmms2`, but on Debian, for example, you might have to compile it [[Install_instructions|by hand]]
# '''Install the Sexp gem.''' Run `ruby -v`: If your system uses Ruby 1.8, you can simply run `gem install sexp`, otherwise you'll have to fetch it by hand and patch it. #FIXME
# '''Clone GIMME from the [http://github.com/konr/GIMME repository].''' Simply run `git clone git://github.com/konr/GIMME.git`
# '''Prepare Emacs'''. Add or link the directory to Emacs's path and add (require â€˜gimme) to your .emacs or init.el file.
# '''M-x gimme'''. And enjoy! :)
