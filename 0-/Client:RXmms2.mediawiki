|description=Rxmms2 is an XMMS/BMP clone written using Ruby and Gtk2. It aims to provide the look & feel of XMMS that you're used to while adding new advanced features like medialib operations, a more advanced display string parser, and regular expression searches. Rxmms2 was conceived and is maintained by [[Daniel Chokola]]. The Rxmms2 homepage can be found at http://dan.chokola.com/software/rxmms2.rhtml.
