Ideas about things that should go in a 'test suite' to make sure xmms2 builds and runs correctly..

* Change songs several times in a row (stress-test?)
* Chain multiple operations into likely sequences (scenarios), repeat
** Need example scenarios
* Mlib song import speed?
* Removing multiple playlist items (or removing single items in quick succession)
