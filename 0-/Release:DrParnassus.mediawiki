=== Notes to client library authors ===

* XMMSV_TYPE_INT32 is now XMMSV_TYPE_INT64, other ints in the header and so on are still 32bit.
* XMMSV_TYPE_FLOAT has been added, which for now is only seen when using aggregate=avg in xmmsc_coll_query.
* XMMSV_TYPE_LIST now has its restricted type before the size field. If the restricted type is set to something other than XMMSV_TYPE_NONE, the following entries will implicitly be of that type and not have their own type field.
* XMMSV_TYPE_COLL now has its attributes written as a regular XMMSV_TYPE_DICT, its idlist written as a XMMSV_TYPE_INT64 restricted list, and operands written as an XMMSV_TYPE_COLL restricted list.

For changes in the available commands, see src/ipc.xml.
