==XMMS2==

XMMS2 is a music player.

<insert one line sales pitch here>


==VERSION==

This README file is for XMMS2 0.3-DrJekyll

The "Dr" does not mean "Doctor", it means "Developer Release".
"Developer Release" means that the target audience for is not
your grandma, but rather developers who wish to help improving
XMMS2, by making clients, plugins, fixing bugs, adding features,
writing documentation or any other thing that would make it
closer to the perfect music player. Of course anyone is allowed
to try it out, but don't expect everything to work flawlessy,
and it is a good thing if you don't mind getting your hands
dirty.
