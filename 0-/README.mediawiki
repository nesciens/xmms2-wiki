This is the new generation of the XMMS player.
There are a lot of questions about the reason for XMMS2,
XMMS2 itself and the design goals. I will try to clarify them.

== General Questions ==

* Q: Why rewrite XMMS?
* A: XMMS is a old project (started in 1997) and was not expected to become as popular as it did. The internal design of XMMS is somewhat ... troublesome, if not completely broken. Also the frameworks around XMMS have changed a lot. The general opinion among the developers was that if ANYTHING should happen, it would be a complete rewrite.

* Q: Who is responsible for XMMS2?
* A: [[Peter Alm]] (original author of XMMS) did the first designs and the initial code. Most of the code is written by [[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]] and [[Anders Gustafsson]]. The project is being maintained by Tobias and Anders. A big thanks goes out to [[Thomas Nilsson]] too, he bitches well.

* Q: Those are not the same developers who maintain XMMS?
* A: That's true. XMMS2 is a separate project. Rest assured, XMMS will live on for a long long time. XMMS2 is not ready any time soon to take over for XMMS1.

* Q: What are the design goals of XMMS2?
* A: XMMS2 is designed to be a kickass music-player. We wanted to rectify a various problems with the XMMS's APIs. For example splitting of theinput-plugin into transport- and decoder-plugins. We also wanted the UI to be separate from the core engine, in order to allow other interfaces than Gtk+ GUI.

* Q: Why just a musicplayer?
* A: A lot of people ask us about video. But video will not be included nor supported in XMMS2, in fact video-support is even less possible than in XMMS1. This choice has numerous reasons. Music and video are very separate things, despite what many people like to think. And we belive that we can make the best musicplayer out there, but not the best videoplayer, so we stick to what we are best at. There are other choices, if you wish to play video and audio via same application.

* Q: But XMMS stands for X MultiMedia System, that includes video!
* A: Wrong. In "XMMS2", XMMS stands for X(cross)platform Music Multiplexing System.

* Q: Seems like you are using a non-standard buildsystem, why not Make?
* A: Make is a really good buildsystem, although to get all functionality  needed for a bigger project you'll need automake, autoconf and libtool. We had a lot of problem getting these tools to do what we wanted, so we evaluated the alternatives. SCons is a good alternative. If you do not want to install Python and SCons on your system, there will be binaries available for most common platforms.

* Q: And you are using BitKeeper as SCM? It's non-free software!!
* A: Yes, but you will be able to download daily snapshots and patches from our webpage if you can't use BK. We will NOT switch to another SCM, end of discussion.

* Q: What platforms will you support?
* A: Our aim is to be able to port XMMS basically everywhere, but development is mainly done on Linux/x86, Linux/PPC and Mac OSX. Support for other platforms is currently secondary, although it has been known to work on OpenBSD and Solaris.

* Q: What about Windows?
* A: Our code should run on Windows without any problems, being ANSI-C. The major showstopper currently is that D-BUS library is not ported to Win32 yet, and since XMMS2 is heavily based around this library, we have to wait for a port. Of course you can port it and thus help XMMS2 and other projects using D-BUS.

== Common questions about usage: ==

* Q: How do I use XMMS2?
* A: XMMS2 is based on client-server model, where most of the logic resides inside the server (XMMS2D). With a client you can send commands to the daemon and play music. For now we only have a commandline client. To install, read the INSTALL file. For usage of xmms2 cli client see the included manpage.

* Q: What other clients are in progress?
* A: We probably will have a offical client based on somekind of skinned-widget library that are still in development (libl44t, questions about this is directed to andersg at xmms dot org). Other people are working on a GTK+ client and a E17 client (enlightenment).

* Q: When will XMMS2 be released for public consumption?
* A: We don't know. Probably "when it's done". RSN.

* Q: How do I get in contact with you guys?
* A: E-Mail: tru at xmms dot org and andersg at xmms dot org IRC: debian.as:6667 #xmms2
