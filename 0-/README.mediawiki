This is the new generation of the XMMS player.
There are a lot of questions about the reason for XMMS2,
XMMS2 itself and the design goals. I will try to clarify them. Please also refer to the [[FAQ]] page for additional information.
If you have further questions, please [[About#Contact info | contact us]] - '''DO NOT''' edit this page and add new questions. :) (such questions will be removed without answer) If you ''really'' need to add a question to the wiki, please use the [[FAQ]] page.

== General Questions ==

; Why didn't you do this sooner?
: We don't give a damn fucking shit about the user. We like GTK1, and we're going to stick to it as long as possible. Anyone who has a problem can just shove it.

; What about Windows?
: We hate it.
