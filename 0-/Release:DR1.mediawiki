'''Developer Release 1''' is the first release of XMMS 2 code, intended primarily for developers who might be interested in contributing code, plugins and working on clients. What it means:

* Core functionality in the daemon has been implemented and major design changes are not planned.
* The client API is relatively stable, so clients can be written without developers having to put a lot of work in maintaining API compatibility to the latest version.

'''NOTE:''' We are ''not'' at the DR1 stage yet, but we're close.

== To Do ==
* Fix include files {{Bug|93}}
* Decoder API fix {{Bug|128}}
* Ensure complete Doxygen coverage
* Fix/investigate config system {{Bug|99}}, {{Bug|97}}, {{Bug|19}}
* Update ''README'', ''INSTALL'' files
* Complete ''sample_t'' fixup (ices) - I don't feel that Ices is superimportant, maybe just disable it? FLAC would be nice to have on the other hand. 
* Make sure that we are consistent in the naming of functions: ''xmms_<module>_<submodule>_<operation>'' e.g. ''transport_plugin_get''()
* Get some real test data/testcases (devising procedures/processes to make sure every module works as expected, plus defining a set of sound samples of various formats to make sure decoder plugins work)
* ''Maybe'' move the wiki to a better machine
* '''See also''': [http://genesis.xmms.se/~andersg/xmms2-short-term-roadmap.txt Anders' roadmap]
* Fix so that we don't crash on quit {{Bug|158}}

== Done (Release Notes) ==
* Fix [[Component:Medialib | Medialib]] logging
* Fix ''python_loop'' in python bindings
* ''Maybe'' fix ''scons install'' hang issue
* Don't quit when we don't get the output inited {{Bug|157}}
