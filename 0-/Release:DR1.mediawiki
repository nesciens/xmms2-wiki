'''Developer Release 1''' is the first release of XMMS 2 code, intended primarily for developers who might be interested in contributing code, plugins and working on clients. What it means:

* Core functionality in the daemon has been implemented and major design changes are not planned.
* The client API is relatively stable, so clients can be written without developers having to put a lot of work in maintaining API compatibility to the latest version.

'''NOTE:''' We are ''not'' at the DR1 stage yet, but we're close.

== To Do ==

* Decoder API fix {{Bug|128}}
* Ensure complete Doxygen coverage
* Fix/investigate config system {{Bug|99}}, {{Bug|97}}, {{Bug|19}}
* Make sure that we are consistent in the naming of functions: ''xmms_<module>_<submodule>_<operation>'' e.g. ''transport_plugin_get''()
* Get some real test data/testcases (devising procedures/processes to make sure every module works as expected, plus defining a set of sound samples of various formats to make sure decoder plugins work)
* ''Maybe'' move the wiki to a better machine
* '''See also''': [http://genesis.xmms.se/~andersg/xmms2-short-term-roadmap.txt Anders' roadmap]

== Done (Release Notes) ==
* Fix [[Component:Medialib | Medialib]] logging
* Fix ''python_loop'' in python bindings
* ''Maybe'' fix ''scons install'' hang issue
* Don't quit when we don't get the output inited {{Bug|157}}
* Fix so that we don't crash on quit {{Bug|158}}
* FLAC updated to sample_t
* Fix include files {{Bug|93}}


=== 2005-04-20 ===
* Huge debug message cleanup
* Lots of doxygen additions.

=== 2005-04-16 ===
* we now use sqlite3
* removed all encoded paths in xmms, this means that we don't need to call encode/decode path all the time. it was a legacy from dbus anyway.
* lot of sqlite tuning. trying to get the speed up.
* added xmms2 mlib addpath command that just sends a path to the server who recursivly adds all the entries under that path to the medialib.

=== 2005-05-05 ===
* Update ''README'', ''INSTALL'' files

== Release Text ==

After over two years of development, the XMMS Team releases the first preview of the next generation XMMS. XMMS2 is a complete rewrite of the XMMS codebase and has been focusing on portability, code separation and stability. An advanced feature of XMMS2 is that the music player process runs separately from the GUI, which means that you can communicate with the player via IPC commands. This will allow developers to create advanced GUIs and not have to care about the music playing part.

We have reached Developer Release 1; this means that the player is NOT ready for public consumption or for replacing XMMS1, RythmBox, AmaroK or MPD. This simply means that we have a very nice working codebase and we are happy to invite developers to help us with this. Feedback and testing is also very helpful at this stage.
