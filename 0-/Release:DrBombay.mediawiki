''This will be the releasenotes for DrBombay''

DrBombay is a bugfix release for [[Release:DrAlban]]. These releasenotes describes changes between DrAlban and DrBombay.

It does not contain any new features, but a number of important bugfixes.

== Noteworthy bug fixes ==
* {{Bug|527}}: Fixed crash on playlist_insert on empty playlists.
* {{Bug|541}}: "enabled" configvalue is now created when effect plugins are loaded, not when they are enabled for the first time. This removes lots of confusion when adding an effect.
* {{Bug|545}}: Encode url correctly when added to medialib in other ways than via the playlist.

== Notes to client authors ==
* xmmsc_sqlite_prepare_string now takes '''const char *''' instead.
* PropDict's has_key() in pythonbindings now works correctly with implicit source.
* size property is now available on media.

== Notes to users ==
'''IMPORTANT''': It also breaks medialib compability without upgrade. So you will have to recreate your medialib.

Also glib at least version 2.6 is required and enforced.

XMMS2 now ships with a new intro clip!
