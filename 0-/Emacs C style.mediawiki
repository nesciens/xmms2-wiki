== .emacs configuration for xmms2 source editing ==

Put this at the end of your .emacs to follow style guidelines.

This is not 100% correct! It doesn't do the correct indentation of multiline statements!!


 (defun xmms2-c-mode ()
   "C mode with adjusted defaults for use with the xmms2."
   (interactive)
   (c-mode)
   (c-set-style "K&R")
   (setq tab-width 4)
   (setq indent-tabs-mode t)
   (setq c-basic-offset 4))
 
 
 (setq auto-mode-alist 
       (cons '("/home/marco/dev/xmms2.*/.*\\.[ch]$" . xmms2-c-mode)  
 	    auto-mode-alist))

== Correct Indentation and Alignment of Multi-Line Statements ==
I've written a [http://code.l3ib.org/?p=.users/syscrash/indent.git;a=summary haskell script] to do this.

It only touches multi-line statements, and preserves whatever
indentation you were using at the beginning of the statement.
