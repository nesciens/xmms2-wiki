=Summary=
Adds support for playing various emulated game music audio formats to XMMS2. This component is required for playback of "ay", "gbs", "gym", "hes", "kss", "nsf", "nsfe", "sap", "spc", "vgm", and "vgz" files.

=Description=
Uses Blargg's Game Music Emulator library to decode.

=Status=
SPC support working!  Properly detects the end of non-looping songs and moves to the next.  Reads most SPC metadata -- reports the genre as Super Nintendo.  Awaiting approval from xmms2 devs for inclusion.  See [[Notes_from_developing_an_xform_plugin]] for a lot more details.
