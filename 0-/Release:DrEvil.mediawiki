== Release Notes ==

Winter in Chile, tropical heat in Europe; wherever you are this new release comes as a cool breeze. The XMMS2 Team is happy to announce the release of '''DrEvil'''. This monster of a release will bring the much expected [[Transforms]] concept and might crash your computer a few times due to the extensive changes. Please be aware that this should be considered as less stable then [[DrDoolittle]], so please use this release to help us find bugs in Transforms and port your plugins to the new API. Also this release fixes a lot of the problems that were around with the older architecture, like gapless playback, FLACs getting played by the MAD plugin and so on.

Another major addition in DrEvil is the new C++ bindings, mostly contributed by Jonne "Eclipser" Lehtinen, with the help of [[User:Theefer | SÃ©bastien Cevey (theefer)]]. They now present a very elegant interface to write clients in C++, using the boost library and wrappers of all clientlib data structures. Please help us find bugs there as well by porting C++ clients to the new API and reporting problems!

We are now aiming for the next release which will include some of the [[Summer of Code 2006 | Summer of Code]] students' contributions.

=== Upgrading ===

Your medialib is again removed. Sorry.

=== Noteworthy changes ===

The biggest change is of course the addition of [[Transforms]].

==== Feature additions ====

Transforms adds as the biggest feature in DrEvil.

The new C++ bindings are the second major addition to this release.

==== Bug fixes ====

Most of the bugs fixed in this cycle is related to Transforms.

=== New platforms ===

No new platforms have been added to DrEvil

=== Notes to client authors ===

* {{Bug|762}} -  Removed views from medialib.
* {{Bug|850}} -  Removed the Log table from medialib.
* {{Bug|781}} -  When a client edits mlib-entries the mlib_entry_changed_broadcast is now called.
* {{Bug|741}} -  'plugin/*' is now the default source preference (instead of 'server').

=== Notes to plugin authors ===

The API is totally new when it comes to decoding / transport and effect plugins. This is unified in the xforms API. Your plugins need to be ported.
