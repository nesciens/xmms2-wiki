Actually, a console client isn't really fast to use.
But there is a way to control your xmms2 server trough your desktop without having to load any software like a Graphical client.

I believe this could apply to other console client.
But I'll go on with [[Client:XMMS2 CLI client | XMMS2 CLI client]].

Once you have a working client and a working server.

The only thing you need to do is to add shortcuts on your deskbar.

If xmms2 and xmms2d are in your /usr/bin directory, you should be able to add write only the name of the executable as it is in the PATH Linux 
is searching for executable binaries.
If xmms2 and xmms2d are not in /usr/bin or any folder of your path...You'll have to provide the absolute path of the executable in the shortcut.

these are commands I use:
xmms2 play // For starting playback
xmms2 stop // For stopping playback
xmms2 next // Next song
xmms2 prev // Previous song
xmms2 quit // For closing xmms2d
xmms2d     // For starting the xmms2 daemon

1. Left click on the deskbar
Select the "add to the deskbar" option

2. The interface may be different depending on your gnome version.

Now you click on "Custom Application Luncher"
It should open a window like that.

Now then, you fill every information needed. It's up to you for the name that will be showed and the comment. Chosing a good icon is really important if you want to not have to remember what button does what. 
There are nice icons for that in /usr/share/pixmaps/gnome-cd/themes/None/ 
Then you should have something like that.

As for my example, xmms wasn't into /usr/bin so I've been forced to use the complete path of the executable.
Don't forget to add the arguments (play,stop,pause,prev,next...) after the name of the executable.

Then when you have made all your buttons.
You should have something like this.

So with that, i can control my music without having to use a graphical client. :)
