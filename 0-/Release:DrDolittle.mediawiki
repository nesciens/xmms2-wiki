== Release Notes ==

Holy handgranates! It's release time again! Much earlier than expected and much cooler than the critics claim! XMMS2 Team announces [[Release:DrDoolittle | Dr. Doolittle]]. This release is forged by the wormholes of Stargate, Swedish schlager music, Chilean beaches and a lament for a loved one. DrDoolittle is a minor-feature-addition and bug-fix release instead of the expected major-break-the-world release. We decided that enough critical fixes and small features were available to make a release. You can watch the new [[Roadmap]] in order to see what's going on with future releases.

Note that some of the API calls have been changed in this release (details in [[Release:DrDoolittle#Full_ChangeLog | full release notes]]) and clients need to be upgraded. The API breaking will (hopefully) stop when Dr. releases end.

XMMS2 Team would like to thank everyone involved in this release, your efforts are appreciated as always. 

=== Upgrading ===

Due to significant changes to the SQLite schema the medialib will (once again) be totaly removed if you upgrade. Tilman provided a [http://code-monkey.de/files/xmms2-mlib-playlist-importer.rb ruby script] for moving your old medialib into the new one.

=== Noteworthy changes ===

==== Feature additions ====
This release will feature a [[mDNS]] agent ({{Bug|455}}) that will allow you to announce the availability of xmms2 servers on your local network. Client authors are suggested to implement browsing capabillities into their code.

The kind guys at X4X (http://x4x.sf.net) supplied XMMS2 clientlib with Java bindings {{Bug|198}}. They are now shipped with the default distribution.

One of the old wishlist bugs has been the abillity to make xmms2d to listen to mulitple sockets {{Bug|644}}. This has been implemented by Karsten Krispin. Just semicolon separate the paths in the config and you are ready to go.

Major speedups has been done for the Medialib ({{Bug|662}}), especially when importing songs to the Medialib. Please always use xmmsc_medialib_import_path() when mass-adding files, cli command is "xmms2 mlib addpath".

==== Bug fixes ====

The following bugs has been flaged as important and fixed.

{{Bug|631}} and {{Bug|681}} fixes two serious misses in the MAD plugin. 631 made some VBR mp3s to have wrong duration and 681 could make xmms2d crash when calculating the duration of errenous mp3s.

{{Bug|688}} - Has been a problem for some time. The mixer events from ALSA wasn't handled properly. This would remove the problems with setting volume in ALSA. The problem was with ALSA documentation and a bugreport has been filed to the alsa team.

{{Bug|655}} Fixes a common crash in the volume broadcast.

=== New platforms ===

No new platforms has been added to DrDoolittle

=== Notes to client authors ===

One function call was renamed: xmmsc_main_status is now called xmmsc_main_stats. See bug {{Bug|652}} for details.

Heaps of new functions was wrapped in Ruby bindings:
* {{Bug|653}} - Wrap xmmsc_configval_list() in the Ruby bindings.
* {{Bug|653}} - Wrap xmmsc_medialib_playlist_remove() in the Ruby bindings.
* {{Bug|682}} - The argument to Xmms::Client#plugin_list is optional now.
* {{Bug|653}} - Wrap xmmsc_medialib_get_id() in the Ruby bindings

A new function was also added:
* {{Bug|630}} -  Added a medialib_entry_add signal.

And the config functions changed behaviour:
* {{Bug|664}} - broadcast_configval_changed now uses the config property's key as the dict entry's key and the config property's value as the dict entry's value.
* {{Bug|669}} - xmmsc_configval_list() now returns a dict that contains the config property's names and values instead of a list of names.

=== Notes to plugin authors ===

The only change that affects plugin authors is the split of name and version in xmms_plugin_new() see bug {{Bug|650}}.
