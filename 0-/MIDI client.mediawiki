Some kind of xmms client that uses midi to send/get commands.

Could be used to control xmms2 from midi-devices. Like (I think it's midi at least) the hercules dj station. Related to [[XMMS2 as a DJ station]]

Could also be used to control other midi-devices when playback starts/stops and other signals.
