{{Client | name=perlamp| author=[[Ralf Engels]]| website=Unknown| version= Unknown| devlanguage=Perl| ui=GTK| screenshots=N/A| description=Perlamp should be a front-end that allows it to open Wxxamp modern skins. 
The current status is a proof-of-concept written in Perl with perlgtk that allows incomplete viewing of several modern skins with Maki support.
Actually the Maki script support is in a very good state, other areas are not.
Interested parties please contact [[Ralf Engels]]}}
