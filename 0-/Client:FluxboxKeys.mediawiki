== Key Bindings ==

Hi all,

I have been using xmms2 for a couple of days, and as a Fluxbox user, I have set some keybindings for listening to music.
This is what I added to my ~/.fluxbox/keys


  Mod4 97 :ExecCommand xmms2 toggleplay
  Mod4 99 :ExecCommand xmms2 prev
  Mod4 105 :ExecCommand xmms2 next
  Mod4 103 :ExecCommand xmms2 stop


I use Win+PgUp , Win+PgDn , Win+Home , Win+End for controlling xmms2. Really simple.

Also, I added the following to my ~/fluxbox/startup:

  [...]
  xmms2-launcher &
  wmxmms2 &
  [...]
  exec /usr/bin/fluxbox -log "~/.fluxbox/log"
