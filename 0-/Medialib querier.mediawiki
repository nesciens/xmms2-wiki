Some kind of tool to generate nice lists of music from the medialib.

Lists that can be used to fill a portable mediaplayer.

Takes a max-size as argument and some kind expression of what kind of songs to prefer when sizeof(medialib) > sizeof(mediaplayer)

Maybe there should be a way to rate the songs so that one could specify to give preference to higher-rated songs.


 13:37 < anders> Fill my mp3player with random songs, but I prefer synth, and
                 make sure the latest added albums are there, exept this really
                 crappy album, and btw, the most played metal-albums would be
                 nice too. And Hey! I just want full albums, don't splitt them,
                 except these songs, which are the only good ones on their albums.
