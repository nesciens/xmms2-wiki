{{Client| name=nxmms2| author=[[Marko Kotar]]| website=[None]| version=0.01| devlanguage=C| ui=Console (ncurses)| screenshots=None| description= nxmms2 is is very primitive but powerful xmms2 client. It can be controlled with pressing keys. Search in media library is the best thing of this client. I have to make a website too. It will take some time. Maybe one day or just a few hours.}}
