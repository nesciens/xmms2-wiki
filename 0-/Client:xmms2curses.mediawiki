{{Client| name=xmms2curses| author=[[Alexander Botero-Lowry]]| website=[http://alex.foxybanana.com/xmms2curses-brokenplaylist.tar.gz alex.foxybanana.com]| version=PreRelease-BrokenPlaylist| devlanguage=C| ui=Console (ncurses)| screenshots=http://www.stampede.org/~drax/x2c.jpg| description=x2c is a client written in C using curses (not specifically ncurses, all code is tested with NetBSD's curses and ncurses). It was started because, sadly, XMMS2Curse seems to be no longer avaliable. Development is stalled because I am very busy with school. Anyone wanting to continue development can grab the source and go at it. The main issue of importance right now is making the playlist scroll correctly.}}
