In the process of porting the collections api to python it becomes apparent that a decision has to be made about how to represent the collections structure.

There are a number of options, two of them are:

1) create a collections class which represents the various collections semantics as properties and attributes (with the occasional method if necessary)

2) create a collections class with the same get/set methods as in the c bindings.

Other ideas welcome!
