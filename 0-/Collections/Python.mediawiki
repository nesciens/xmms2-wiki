In the process of porting the collections api to python it becomes apparent that a decision has to be made about how to represent the collections structure.

There are a number of options, two of them are:

''All python examples use Sync API for simplciity''

1) create a collections class which represents the various collections semantics as properties and attributes (with the occasional method if necessary)

 coll_foo = xc.coll_get(foo)
 ids = coll_foo.ids
 idl_coll = xc.Collection(XMMS_COLL_TYPE_IDLIST)
 idl_coll.ids = ids

2) create a collections class with the same get/set methods as in the c bindings.

Other ideas welcome!
