After a [[Talk:Mediatags|discussing]] about how to tag media with more information, we concluded the best way is to implement it transparent on the client side. As clients normally don't need that information, it is enough to have a local style for managing the media. If I client still wants to add a shortcut for certain fields or wants to show statistics about certain fields, here's an idea for a standard interface.
{| class="wikitable" 
! field
! multi
! description
! examples
|- 
| mood   || yes || || chillout, aggressive
|- 
| style  || yes || addition to genre, you can have a Chinese sounding pop song) || chinese, medival
|- 
| speed || no  || speed in words || lame, slow, normal, fast, speeding
|- 
| bpm   || no  || speed in bpm || 120, 90
|- 
| tag   || yes || anyithing else || foo, bar
|-
|}
Feel free to add/change things, as this table still is evolving.

Some fields can have more as one value. unless xmms2d supports arrays as values, a semicolon separated list is used.
