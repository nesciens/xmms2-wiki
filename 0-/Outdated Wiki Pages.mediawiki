These Pages need some updates:

* [[FAQ]]
** When will XMMS2 be released As a non-Developer release?
*** isn't that already the case?
** Why does XMMS2 require SQLite3 and why is the db backend not selectable?
*** is the s4 switch ready yet?
** How do I bind hotkeys to xmms2 commands?
*** maybe link to the contribs page?
** Seems like you are using a non-standard buildsystem, why not Make?
*** the waf switch is already done, isn't it?
** When I add my media collection to the playlist, x files don't show up.
*** the bug mentioned in A2 is marked as resolved. should that part be removed?

* [[Contribs]]
** XPLAY
*** The svn server doesn't work any more
** Init Scripts
*** the bug has since been rejected, remove this, too?
** BSD init scripts
*** the contrib folder on xmms2.xmms.se 404s.
** Play-Pause toggle client (python, C)
*** nycli does this perfectly, does it not? why have it?
** XChat2 info script
*** the server doesn't seem to exist any more. remove it?
** Bash tab completion for the xmms2 client
*** the page linked to ("bash tab completion for the CLI") seems much more comprehensive. but is it still up to date?
** the rest still needs looking at.
