''' DONE in DR2 '''

This should be an option to automatically play random songs from the medialib. This could be done in several ways:

* Adding new files to the playlist when you reach the last entry
** when we reach the last entry we add X new songs to the playlist
** could be combined with a "remove entry from playlist when played"
* Cheating in some way so that you don't add them to the playlist.

The SQL statement for choosing the "random" song should be configurable.
