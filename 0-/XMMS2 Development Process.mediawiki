This is an overview of the XMMS2 development process - it covers the process to go through when modifying code that ends up in the main code tree (''xmms2-devel''), as well as outlining other trees.

= Code trees =

These are the trees found at http://git.xmms.se
* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-anders.git;a=summary xmms2-anders]
** [[User:Anders_Gustafsson | Anders]]' tree - where lots of code ninja happens.
* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-devel.git;a=summary xmms2-devel]
** The main development tree, where all approved changes end up.
* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-eleusis.git;a=summary xmms2-eleusis]
** [[Sham Chukoury | Sham]]'s tree - where minor bug fixes and documentation fixes are occasionally committed.
* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-jlt.git;a=summary xmms2-jlt]
** [[Jens Taprogge | Jens]]' tree - where changes relating to Debian packaging are made.
* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-nano.git;a=summary xmms2-nano]
** [[Daniel Pearson | Daniel]]'s tree.
* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-stable.git;a=summary xmms2-stable]
** The stable tree, where code from the ''xmms2-devel'' tree ends up prior to a release.
* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-tilman.git;a=summary xmms2-tilman]
** [[Tilman Sauerbeck | Tilman]]'s tree - where some code ninja happens.
* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-tru.git;a=summary xmms2-tru]
** [[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m | Tobias]]'s tree - where even more code ninja happens.

= Change process =

* Get an idea for a feature/plugin, or find a bug somewhere. Optionally discuss it with other people in the XMMS2 community.
# [[Reporting bugs | File a bug or feature report]]. You will need to register on the Mantis bug tracker if you don't already have an account.
#* If you've already got code to submit (e.g. a new plugin), you'll still need to file a report - it's how we track changes to the codebase. Skip step 2.
# If you're not lazy and you think you're up to it, work on the bug or feature or plugin and submit your file(s) via Mantis.
#* If your code is too complex to submit via Mantis (e.g. too many files), you might want to [[About#Contact info | contact us]] via e-mail or IRC to discuss a more convenient way of submitting your code.
#* You can seek feedback from the XMMS2 community by offering code and patches for review while working on the problem, before submission.
# If your submission is deemed of good enough quality (i.e. works, doesn't introduce any obvious bugs, memleaks, and so on), it will be merged into one of the code trees and eventually end up in ''xmms2-devel''.
# The bug/feature report will be closed on mantis with the matching git commit ID.
# You'll probably end up in the ''AUTHORS'' file, if you're not in there already.

In summary: The Mantis issue tracker is a '''vital''' component of, and primary entry point to the XMMS2 development process. Use it well.
