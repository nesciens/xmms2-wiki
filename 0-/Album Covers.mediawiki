Clients should use the client/generic/arturl source with the various album_*_* properties. These properties are all urls, but urls can be to a file:// of course so covers can be locally cached. Locally cached covers should go to ~/.xmms2/clients/generic/art/ the filenames should be the md5 checksum of the "$artist-$album" all in lowercase, followed by the size which should be one of small, large, or thumbnail. Information about the actual sizes can be found at [[Generic properties policy]].
An example filename might be 33aa73b5ddbccffcb485c42c2b14fae7-thumbnail.jpg

Any client that automatically looks up album art should put it into the client/generic/arturl_unverified source until it can be verified by the user. xmms2covers is on the way, and one can play with some of it by grabbing it from GIT. It currently can pull from musicbrainz or from the iTunes music store, but modules can be added to expand this.
