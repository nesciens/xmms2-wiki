=Using xmmsfs=

To start, mount xmmsfs on an empty directory:

 % ./xmmsfs mlib

If you list the contents of `mlib` now, you will see all of the ids in your media library. With xmmsfs, the contents of each directory are dictated by its path name. For instance, the contents of a directory `album/Brothers/` will be all of the songs in the album, "Brothers". A path ending with the name of a property will list all of the media with that property as well as possible values for that property, taken from your library.

Wildcard characters are also supported; however, in a terminal they must be escaped with a backslash or quoted. Adding operators like "OR", and "NOT" to a given field name modifies the contents accordingly:

 % ls -l "date/2010/OR date/1990/date"
 total 0
 dr-xr-xr-x 1 twock twock 4096 Jan 24 17:57 1990
 dr-xr-xr-x 1 twock twock 4096 Jan 24 17:57 2010

By default, queries will use simple string matching. To do numerical comparisons, prefix one of <, >, <=, or >= to the value you want to compare against.
