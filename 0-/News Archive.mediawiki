{{Newsitem|date=27 April 2006 WST (2006-04-27)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=XMMS2's Summer of Code| text=G'day folks. With Google's [http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html Summer of Code] returning this year, the XMMS2 team submitted a proposal to be a 'mentoring organisation'. <strike>Unfortunately, our proposal didn't make it through, but the proposed ideas are still here! If you're interested in some summer codin' fun (or winter codin' fun, for those of us in the other hemisphere), check out XMMS2's very own [[Summer of Code 2006]] ideas. ;)</strike>

Scratch that. Turns out we made it in after all! If you're a student, you might want to take a look at our [[Summer of Code 2006]] ideas page and consider sending in your application. ;)}}

{{Newsitem|date=27 March 2006 CLST (2006-03-27)| author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]| title=Cute and cuddly| text=Holy handgranates! It's release time again! Much earlier than expected and much cooler than the critics claim! XMMS2 Team announces [[Release:DrDoolittle | Dr. Doolittle]]. This release is forged by the wormholes of Stargate, Swedish schlager music, Chilean beaches and a lament for a loved one. DrDoolittle is a minor-feature-addition and bug-fix release instead of the expected major-break-the-world release. We decided that enough critical fixes and small features were available to make a release. You can watch the new [[Roadmap]] in order to see what's going on with future releases.

Note that some of the API calls have been changed in this release (details in [[Release:DrDoolittle#Full_ChangeLog | full release notes]]) and clients need to be upgraded. The API breaking will (hopefully) stop when Dr. releases end.

XMMS2 Team would like to thank everyone involved in this release, your efforts are appreciated as always.}}

{{Newsitem|date=21 Febrary 2006 CLST (2006-02-21)| author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]| title=So how's that coma going for ya there?| text=Good news everyone. New release from the XMMS2 Team. [[Release:DrCox | DrCox]] is a bugfix / regression release which focuses on stability and some smaller feature enhancements. All users are recommended to upgrade to DrCox. The XMMS2 community is still growing with new users and contributors, just like any opensource project your involvement is necessary to bring the project forward. Please join us on IRC or our Maillist to participate.

Source is available for download from [http://sf.net/projects/xmms2 sourceforge].

A heartwarm thanks goes out to all contributors, hang-arounds and fans.

Next release is [[Release:DrDoolittle|DrDoolittle]] which (despite the name) probably going to include some big changes.}}

However ''xmms2d'' will not automatically preserve your configuration settings - instead, it will revert to default settings and subsequently overwrite the configuration file. If you want to preserve your settings, try this command:

 sed -e "s/value/property/g" xmms2.conf>tmp;mv tmp xmms2.conf;

and add a 'version' attribute to the root ''<xmms>'' tag:

 <xmms version="0.02">

{{Newsitem|date=07 September 2005 (2005-09-07) WST|author=[[Sham Chukoury]]|title=Developer Release 2.2|text=More good news everyone! The XMMS2 Team is releasing another bugfix release of the current Developer Release ([[Release:DR2|DR2]]) called [[Release:DR2.2 | DR2.2]]. 

Some outstanding issues have forced us to release another maintenance release in the DR2 series instead of making a DR3 release, including the fixing of a couple of huge memory leaks. Another annoying bug is that XMMS2 doesn't work at all with newer SQLite (3.2.5 and higher) releases because of a policy change; we were misusing the API and they made such usage fail with a hard error. This has '''not''' been fixed in this maintenance release since it is a major change to our internal API. It will be fixed in the upcoming [[Release:DR3 | DR3]] release.

Source is available at [[Download XMMS2#Source | sourceforge]] as usual.

{{Newsitem|date=20 August 2005 (2005-08-20) WST|author=[[Sham Chukoury]]|title=Wiki issues|text=There have been a few changes to the wiki backend and things might still be a bit shaky.. You might encounter this particular scenario:

Clicking on a link to a wiki page (say, page B) from another wiki page (say, page A) might lead you to a URL like ''<nowiki>http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/wiki/index.php/Page_B</nowiki>'' and result in a ''404 Page not found'' error. The '/wiki' bit in the URL is erroneous.

To fix this, go back to page A, append '?action=purge' (without quotes) to the URL (i.e. ''<nowiki>http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/wiki/index.php/Page_A?action=purge</nowiki>'') and press Enter (or click 'Go' or whatever, to load the URL). This will cause the wiki to purge cached links and re-generate them. This only has to be done once for any broken page, so subsequent users won't have to worry about this.

If you still have any other problems with the wiki (or other XMMS2 pages), please drop by #xmms2 on irc.freenode.net and let us know.

Thanks for your patience.}}
{{Newsitem|date=19 August 2005 (2005-08-19) CET|author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]|title=Developer Release 2.1|text=Good news everyone! The XMMS2 Team is releasing a bugfix release of the current Developer Release ([[Release:DR2|DR2]]) called [[Release:DR2.1|DR2.1]]. This corrects some annoyances found by the community, the most prominent of those being an ID3v2.3 parsing error.

This release is compatible with DR2 and will not break the plugin API, medialib or client communication (we think).

Source is available at [[Download XMMS2#Source | sourceforge]] as usual.

The XMMS2 Team is happy to announce the release of XMMS2 [[Release:DR2|Developer Release 2]]. Delayed for a couple of weeks due to summer, beer, (plastic) women and other real life nonsense, we release a feature-packed second version of XMMS2. This release is the direct result of feedback from DR1 on both APIs, functionality and behaviour. We would like to thank everyone who provided us with feedback, patches and encouragement.

{{Newsitem|date=20 may 2005 (2005-05-20) CET|author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]|title=Developer Release 1|text=After over two years of development, the XMMS Team releases the first
preview of the next generation XMMS. XMMS2 is a complete rewrite of
the XMMS codebase and has been focusing on portability, code
separation and stability. An advanced feature of XMMS2 is that the
music player process runs separately from the user interface in a
client/server model. This simplifies the process of creating alternate
user interfaces and allow interface developers to concentrate on
designing the interface for their special need and not having to care
about the music playing part.

XMMS2 has now reached Developer Release 1! The target audience for
this release is developers, the player is NOT yet ready for public
consumption or for replacing XMMS1, RythmBox, AmaroK or MPD. This
simply means that the codebase is very nice and developers are
encouraged to help creating plugins and clients that will make XMMS2
the de facto standard for music playing, like XMMS1 has been for
almost a decade. At this point there are no mature and stable GUI
clients, but this preview is released in the hope that the development
of interfaces will accelerate.

We are also happy to include a music clip donated by industrial act Dismantled (http://www.dismantled.org/) in the distrbution.
