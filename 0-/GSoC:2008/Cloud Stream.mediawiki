|description=
As my abstract says, this summer, I will be focusing on evolving the last.fm take on music playing/browsing to better integrate it with the local collections/meta data. Cloud Stream is meant to provide a dynamic interface that supplements the users track choices with statistical data from both history as well as other last.fm users' music history.
