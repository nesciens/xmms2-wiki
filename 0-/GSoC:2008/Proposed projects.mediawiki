{{SoCItem| title=[[Generated IPC | Auto-generated API and bindings]]| description=Currently, the C client library and the bindings (Python, Ruby, etc) have to be manually updated whenever a new function is introduced on the server. This work is tedious and mechanical, and the whole client API could in fact be automatically generated from a high-level description of the functions. The goal is therefore to determine the semantics of these descriptions (possibly using XML), and then use them to generate the different API source files. There is already some proof of concept.| lang=Python / XML| level=Advanced| mentor=N/A}}

{{SoCItem| title=Media Library Database Backend (S4)| description=XMMS2 uses sqlite as the backend for its media library. Since XMMS2 basically maps a key-value pairing,   it has been aruged that using an sql database in this case is suboptimal. This project would be to take advantage of the abstraction provided by Collections, and look into implementing other backends for the XMMS2 media library. This project would include performance testing of the various potential databases.| lang=C| level=Hard| mentor=N/A}}

{{SoCItem| title=XMMS2-specific GUI toolkit widgets (gtk or qt)| description=XMMS2 clients developed for gtk or qt often implement the same widgets for displaying playlists, media status, and the media library. This project would be to implement a set of widgets for developing an xmms2 client for one of the popular toolkits. The study of existing music players and interest in HCI would be required. Advanced examples include: a rich medialib display (scriptable, see [http://www.foobar2000.org/ foobar2000]), a graphical editor for [[Collections_Concept | Collections]], cover art manager, preferences panel for changing configvals, etc.| lang=probably C or C++| level=Medium to Hard| mentor=N/A}}

{{SoCItem| title=Multiple channel support| description=New formats like AC3 and DTS supports multiple channels. XMMS2 is kind of prepared for this but without any decent support in the output plugins. The task will be to get full multiple channel support in XMMS2 for the pulseaudio, alsa and oss output (bonus if coreaudio also supports it!)| lang=C| level=Medium to hard| mentor=N/A}}

{{SoCItem| title=xmmsclient-easy| description=Development of a higher-level client library, that would include features many clients have in common.

{{SoCItem| title=New service clients| description=Development of multiple service clients, to be discussed.
