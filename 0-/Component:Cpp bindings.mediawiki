= Summary =
C++ bindings for the client library.

== Prerequisites ==

* DrEvil or later.
* Various [http://www.boost.org boost] libraries/headers
** [http://www.boost.org/libs/bind/bind.html boost.bind] headers
** [http://www.boost.org/libs/function/index.html boost.function] headers
** [http://www.boost.org/libs/variant/index.html boost.variant] headers
** [http://www.boost.org/libs/type_traits/index.html boost.type_traits] headers
** [http://www.boost.org/libs/signals/index.html boost.signals] library
* Standard conformant C++ compiler such as G++ 3.3 or later.
: We use the preferred syntax of boost.function and boost.signal so any compiler that doesn't handle that won't work, they're listed [http://www.boost.org/doc/html/signals/tutorial.html#id2731333 here]

== Building ==

Just make sure the prerequisites are met and scons will build the bindings with the rest of the stuff.

== Usage ==

There are tutorials for the C++ bindings in [http://git.xmms2.org/xmms2/xmms2-tutorial/ xmms2-tutorial.git] tree.

== Notes ==
