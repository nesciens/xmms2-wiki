SeMMiX is a GTK2-based client for media servers, written in C.
The main reason for this project to exist, is to provide a way to connect to several servers and to show them in a single GUI. Currently, the development is centered on XMMS2 support, and it tries to integrate most of the features provided by the xmmsclient lib.
