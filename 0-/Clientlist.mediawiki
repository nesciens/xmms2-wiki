= Abandoned/Deprecated Clients =

The following clients aren't worked on anymore, and mostly won't work out of the box with a decent version of XMMS2. They could still be useful for developers though:


{{ClientSummary| name=XMMS2www| description=Previously on this page as 'Unnamed PHP client'. This project is reported as 'kind of dead at this time'.}}

{{ClientSummary| name=xmms2-shell| description=xmms2-shell is an interactive shell client for XMMS2. It's like [http://freshmeat.net/projects/xmms-shell/ xmms-shell], but with commands matching the XMMS2 CLI client.}}

{{ClientSummary| name=XMMS2Curse| description=XMMS2Curse is a python client using ncurses for its interface.}}

{{ClientSummary| name=xmms2curses| description=x2c is a client written in C using curses (not specifically ncurses, all code is tested with NetBSD's curses and ncurses).}}

{{ClientSummary| name=xmms2play| description=xmms2play is a simple GTK2 xmms2 client written in C. It is designed for those that desire a minimalist design. It does not include a playlist, instead intending for external applications such as [[Client:medialib-ui | medialib-ui]] to be used for that purpose.}}

{{ClientSummary| name=perlamp| description=Perlamp should be a front-end that allows it to open Wxxamp modern skins. The current status is a proof-of-concept written in Perl with perlgtk that allows incomplete viewing of several modern skins with Maki support.}}

{{ClientSummary| name=XMMS2 xml-rpc| description=A ruby client thats an xml-rpc server, Also included is a php xml-rpc client.}}

{{ClientSummary| name=medialib-ui| description=This is a standalone medialib and playlist client. Aimed at functionality instead of pretty visuals. The idea is to have the client as a complement of a desktop-nice xmms client.}}

{{ClientSummary| name=RXmms2| description=RXmms2 is an XMMS/BMP clone written using Ruby and Gtk2. It aims to provide the look & feel of XMMS that you're used to while adding new advanced features like medialib operations, a more advanced display string parser, and regular expression searches.}}
