I really really like this ones. I like the speaker that doesn't look like an eye (top-left on the second image). Could we get a sample with that one and the "halo"?  The others are to much eye-like, could they be done less eye-like?. I would also like to see these logos with the XMMS2 text somewhere. The ghost is kind of cool also. Colours are fine, the blue one esp.
