I really really like this ones. I like the speaker that doesn't look like an eye (top-left on the second image). Could we get a sample with that one and the "halo"?  The others are to much eye-like, could they be done less eye-like?. I would also like to see these logos with the XMMS2 text somewhere. The ghost is kind of cool also. Colours are fine, the blue one esp.


: simply beautiful.  All of them.  I'd like to see some indication of the software name, but otherwise, these are just plain attractive. [[User:192.103.41.201|192.103.41.201]] 10:51, 16 Jul 2005 (PDT)

; puzzles:
I have to agree. Personally, I like the top two angled versions of concept 3. They have a Mac OSX-ish look to them and are very sleek, yet still simple enough to be easily recognizeable. Though I think tru is right about the eye look, perhaps you could add some shading around the white of the eye to make it look like a speaker cone? You clearly put some good effort into these and I'm even interested in using one of the scope-ghosts from concept 4 in my own client. Great work!
