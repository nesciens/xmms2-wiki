This is a maintenance release, fixing bugs found in [[Release:DR2.1]].

= Release notes =

Good news everyone! The XMMS2 Team is releasing a bugfix release of the current Developer Release ([[Release:DR2|DR2]]) called DR2.2. 

Some outstanding issues has forced us to release another maintainence release in the DR2 serie instead of making a DR3 release. A couple of huge memoryleaks has been tracked down. Another annoying bug is that XMMS2 doesn't work at all with newer SQLite (3.2.5 and higher) because of a policy change, we where missusing the API and they did it a hard error. This has NOT been fixed in this maintainence release since it was a major change to our internal API. It has been fixed in the upcomming DR3 release.

Source is available at [[Download XMMS2#Source | sourceforge]] as usual.

Now have a nice day!
