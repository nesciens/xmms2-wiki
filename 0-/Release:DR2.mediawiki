'''Developer Release 2''' is the second release of XMMS 2 code. What it means:

* Fix more bugs?
* No one really knows yet. ;)

NOTE: We are not at the DR2 stage yet, in fact, we may be very far away.

<span style="color: red">This page only exists at this stage as a place to collect todo items and ideas for DR2.</span>

== To Do ==
* ''maybe'' change mime type handling {{Bug|65}} (see bug notes)
** this may change the plugin API
* '''really''' write a bunch of test scripts, optionally with a set of test sound samples.
** maybe this should be kept separate from the main tree? the sound samples, especially, could be quite large
* ''maybe'' get some more plugins in. :P
** Ogg -> flac, vorbis
** MKA
* DAAP?
** transport plugin? (XMMS2 as client) client should be able to browse DAAP shares and add daap:// urls, perhaps.
** effect plugin? (XMMS2 as daemon) though it might be better if this is left to a dedicated DAAP daemon: daapd
** [[Music Sharing]]

== Done ==
