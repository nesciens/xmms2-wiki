'''Developer Release 2''' is the second release of XMMS 2 code. What it means:

* Make adjustments in the api according to needs of new plugins/clients. Hopefully these are very minor (or totaly non-existant if we are lucky)
* Fix bugs
* No one really knows yet. ;)

NOTE: We are not at the DR2 stage yet, in fact, we may be very far away.

== To Do ==
* ''maybe'' change mime type handling {{Bug|65}} (see bug notes)
** this will most probably change the plugin API
* provide wave-data for vis-clients, not just frequency-data.
* '''really''' write a bunch of test scripts, optionally with a set of test sound samples.
** maybe this should be kept separate from the main tree? the sound samples, especially, could be quite large.
** Yes this should definitly be a separate repository, were testing procedures are defined and media files for testing and scripts to do automatic testing are available for download.
* Have a good method for building out of tree plugins.
* ''maybe'' get some more plugins in. :P
** Ogg -> flac, vorbis
** MKA
* DAAP?
** transport plugin? (XMMS2 as client) client should be able to browse DAAP shares and add daap:// urls, perhaps.
** <strike>effect plugin? (XMMS2 as daemon)</strike>. Way better left to a dedicated DAAP daemon; daapd.
** [[Music Sharing]]

== Done ==
