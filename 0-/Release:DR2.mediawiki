'''Developer Release 2''' is the second release of XMMS 2 code. What it means:

* Make adjustments in the API according to needs of new plugins/clients. Hopefully these are very minor (or totally non-existent if we are lucky)
* Fix bugs
* No one really knows yet. ;)

NOTE: We are not at the DR2 stage yet, in fact, we may be very far away.

== To Do ==

=== Likely ===
* change mime type handling {{Bug|65}} (see bug notes)
** this will most probably change the plugin API
* provide wave-data for vis-clients, not just frequency-data.
* id3v2.4 support {{Bug|152}}
* [[Random songs support]] {{Bug|90}}
* [[General Notify support]] {{Bug|50}}


=== Unlikely ===
* write a bunch of test scripts, optionally with a set of test sound samples.
** maybe this should be kept separate from the main tree? the sound samples, especially, could be quite large.
*** Yes this should definitely be a separate repository, where testing procedures are defined and media files for testing and scripts to do automatic testing are available for download.
* Have a good method for building out-of-tree (third party) plugins.
* ''maybe'' get some more plugins in. :P
** Ogg -> flac, vorbis
** MKA
* DAAP?
** transport plugin? (XMMS2 as client) client should be able to browse DAAP shares and add daap:// urls, perhaps.
** <strike>effect plugin? (XMMS2 as daemon)</strike>. Way better left to a dedicated DAAP daemon; daapd.
** [[Music Sharing]]

=== From DR1 ===
* Make sure that we are consistent in the naming of functions: ''xmms_<module>_<submodule>_<operation>'' e.g. ''transport_plugin_get''()
* ''Maybe'' move the wiki to a better machine
* Fix/investigate config system {{Bug|99}}, {{Bug|97}}, {{Bug|19}}

== Done ==
* Start-up Hooks (2005-05-29)
