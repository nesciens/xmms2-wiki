'''Developer Release 2''' is the second release of XMMS 2 code. What it means:

* Make adjustments in the API according to needs of new plugins/clients. Hopefully these are very minor (or totally non-existent if we are lucky)
* Fix bugs
* Add tons with new bugs and new features that will make xmms2 crash in exciting new ways.

== Release notes ==

Hello intrawebb. The XMMS2 Team is happy to announce the release of XMMS2 [[Release:DR2 | Developer Release 2]]. Delayed for a couple of weeks due to summer, beer, (plastic) women and other real life nonsense, we release a feature-packed second version of XMMS2. This release is the direct result of feedback from DR1 on both APIs, functionality and behaviour. We would like to thank everyone who provided us with feedback, patches and encouragement.

We've come quite a long way since DR1 and DR1.1, and not just code-wise.. Our ''#xmms2'' channel on Freenode has grown considerably, with users and client developers frequently coming and going, or simply lurking around. Project-wise, there have been a number of small improvements here and there:
* A new mini-homepage at http://xmms2.xmms.org/ (featuring a cool map, of all things!)
* A new 'contribs' page at http://xmms2.xmms.org/contrib/
* The [http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se Bug tracker] becoming more and more integral to the process of working on XMMS2 code, especially with:
* The use of specific [[ChangeLog Format | commit tags]] to categorise changes to the code tree.
* Not related specifically to the XMMS2 team, but new [[ XMMS2 Clients]] have been popping up like mushrooms, as developers have dared to install XMMS2 and been inspired to create some funky clients.
* An increased rate of contributions and bug fixes from other users and developers than just the XMMS2 team. (keep them coming!)
* Also thanks to the freenode channel, we've been receiving feature requests from certain specialised users (read: DJs) about things they'd like to see in XMMS2. Stay tuned while we work on these..

This release breaks the client API, the plugin API, as well as your current medialib. Please understand that this is pre-release software and should only be downloaded and used by developers not end-users.

To review the ChangeLog please check the wiki http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/

Oh, and happy birthday to Sham!

== To Do ==

=== Likely ===
* change mime type handling {{Bug|65}} (see bug notes)
** this will most probably change the plugin API
** DR3?
* provide wave-data for vis-clients, not just frequency-data. {{Bug|192}}
** DR3?
* Allow open/init in output-plugins to fail. And make open in oss/alsa non blocking. Report error accordingly. {{Bug|191}}
** I really want this for DR2
* Fix/investigate config system {{Bug|99}}, {{Bug|97}}, {{Bug|19}}
** Hmm. I should really do this for DR2
* Make medialib async for internal callers {{Bug|190}}
** This is a PITA... DR3?
* Add support for multiple IPC sockets {{Bug|89}}
** DR3?
* write a bunch of test scripts, optionally with a set of test sound samples.
** DR3?
** maybe this should be kept separate from the main tree? the sound samples, especially, could be quite large.
*** Yes this should definitely be a separate repository, where testing procedures are defined and media files for testing and scripts to do automatic testing are available for download.

=== Unlikely ===
* Have a good method for building out-of-tree (third party) plugins.
* ''maybe'' get some more plugins in. :P
** Ogg -> flac, vorbis
** MKA
* DAAP?
** transport plugin? (XMMS2 as client) client should be able to browse DAAP shares and add daap:// urls, perhaps.
** <strike>effect plugin? (XMMS2 as daemon)</strike>. Way better left to a dedicated DAAP daemon; daapd.
** [[Music Sharing]]

== Done ==
* Start-up Hooks (2005-05-29)
* [[Random songs support]] {{Bug|90}}
* id3v2.4 support {{Bug|152}}
* [[General Notify support]] {{Bug|50}}
* fix a sql-quoting function for clients.
