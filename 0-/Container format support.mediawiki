A container format can hold different types of metadata describing media-files.
For example, a CD can have a tracklist, an albumcover, lyrics, and so on.

The significance being, that some people prefer to keep one CD as one file (for various reasons, most notably pregaps and gapless playback), and [http://matroska.org matroska] caters to this by allowing you to keep a CUE-file (single-CD playlist) in the container-file.

It would be nice if XMMS2 could accomodate reading mka-files, and display the tracks within in the playlist, preferably hierarchically - expand the track-titles for a CD on double-click, else keep the entry for each CD to a single line.

There is currently a plugin for XMMS which allows you to play a single media-file indexed by a CUE-file, but it's not quite the best solution.
