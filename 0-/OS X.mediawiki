== Installation notes == 
Download and install [http://www.macports.org/ macports]

Install glib-2.0 and sqlite through macports with the command: "port install sqlite3 glib2". Then, make sure that '/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig' is on your PKG_CONFIG_PATH. Now you should be good to compile xmms2 on your Mac OS X Tiger.


Support for major plugins and formats require the following additional macports:
* python bindings: py26-cython
* nycli: libreadline
* mp3: libmad
* flac: flac
* vorbis: libvorbis

Say you've installed MacPorts under /opt/local, the following should produce a xmms2 build for you once you've installed the dependencies:

 ./waf configure --conf-prefix=/opt/local --prefix=/opt/local
 ./waf build
 sudo ./waf install

== CoreAudio output ==
XMMS2 has Native support for CoreAudio, no more fulhack as in XMMS1 using a hacked ESD.

== CoreFoundation eventloop. ==

For client writers, the [http://git.xmms.se/xmms2/xmms2-stable/tree/src/include/xmmsclient/xmmsclient-cf.h libxmmsclient-cf] library contains glue to integrate libxmmsclient with the CoreFoundation main loop.
