== Installation notes ==
 11:53 <eleusis> so how exactly do you build xmms2 on osx, the Right(tm) way? :P
 11:53 <tru_> you install glib2, mad, vorbis from fink.
 11:53 <eleusis> mhm
 11:53 <tru_> you make a .pc file for your sqlite.
 11:54 <tru_> you install pyrex, and scons the normal way (download and run setup.py install)
 11:54 <eleusis> sqlite3 from fink?
 11:54 <tru_> eleusis: no, tiger ships sqlite3. with nice patches that aren't included in the 
             fink one... yet.
 11:54 <eleusis> right
 11:54 <eleusis> so tiger comes with sqlite3 headers and all?
 11:55 <tru_> yes, but not the .pc file.

Here is the .pc file I use. Drop it in /sw/lib/pkgconfig
 prefix=/usr
 exec_prefix=${prefix}
 libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
 includedir=${prefix}/include
 Name: sqlite3 
 Description: SQLite
 Requires:
 Version: 3.2.1
 Libs: -L${libdir} -lsqlite3
 Cflags: -I${includedir}


* if you compile with fink add the CPPPATH=/sw/include argument when compiling with scons
* if  you compiled dependencies with darwinports, try the following command: scons CPPPATH=/opt/local/include LIBPATH=/opt/local/lib

== CoreAudio output ==
XMMS2 has Native support for CoreAudio, no more fulhack as in XMMS1 using a hacked ESD.

== Cocoa/Carbon glue for the CoreFoundation eventloop. ==
Daniel has written a CF eventloop handler for the client lib. expect information about it here.
