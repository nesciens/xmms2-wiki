This FAQ exists as a complement to the [[Read me first!]] page. Less important questions (which may still be asked frequently) come here. You're free to add new questions and answers here. :)

== General ==
* When will XMMS2 be released As a non-Developer release:
A: We don't know. Probably "when it's done". RSN.

* What is the difference between MPD (Music Player Daemon) and XMMS2?:
A: See [[XMMS2 vs MPD]]

* Will you be allowing for 'skinning' to allow us to customize the look?

== Usage ==
'''Hint''': ''Also see the [[Users]] page''

=== How do I use XMMS2? ===
* A: XMMS2 is based on the client-server model, where most of the logic resides inside the server (XMMS2D). With a client, you can send commands to the daemon and play music. For now we only have a commandline client. To install, read the INSTALL file. For usage of xmms2 cli client see the included manpage and [[Using the application]].

=== What other clients are in progress? ===
* A: See [[XMMS2 Clients]].

=== Does XMMS2 run on my favourite platform/operating system? ===
* A: See the [[Project Status#XMMS2_Platform_Support_Status | Platform support status table]] for an overview. For information about mobile platforms (Palm PDA, Sharp Zaurus, etc), see [[Mobile platforms]].

=== XMMS2 is not working. What should I do? ===
* A: You should do it right, of course. Stop doing it wrong, and it'll start working.

=== While trying to start xmms2, I get ''ERROR: Could not create default configfile!!'' ===
* A: This can happen when you've installed XMMS2 for the first time. You need to run ''xmms2d'' first, then run ''xmms2'' to control the daemon. Running ''xmms2d'' will create the configuration directory as required, so that XMMS2 clients can then create their own configuration files. For more information, please see [[Using the application]].

=== How do I load an m3u playlist? ===
* A: You'll need to import the playlist into an mlib playlist first, then load the mlib playlist. (This also means that once you've loaded a playlist this way, you don't need the m3u file anymore)
 xmms2 mlib import_playlist <name> playlist.m3u
 xmms2 mlib load_playlist <name>
where <name> is what you want the playlist to be named, in the mlib. Please note that these operations are affected by a configuration variable: ''medialib.playlist_load_on_import'', which defaults to ''0''. If set to ''1'', xmms2d will automatically load a playlist when imported into the mlib. (Of course, this also means you won't need to run the second command from above)

== Development ==
=== How do I contribute code to XMMS2? ===
* A: Please see the [[Submitting code]] page.

=== Why cogito/git? What was wrong with cvs? ===
* A: Thats like asking "Why icecream? What was wrong with meatloaf?" when you want a dessert.
