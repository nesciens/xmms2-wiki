== General ==
=== When will XMMS2 be released for public consumption? ===
* A: We don't know. Probably "when it's done". RSN.

== Usage ==
'''Hint''': ''Also see the [[Users]] page''

=== How do I use XMMS2? ===
* A: XMMS2 is based on the client-server model, where most of the logic resides inside the server (XMMS2D). With a client, you can send commands to the daemon and play music. For now we only have a commandline client. To install, read the INSTALL file. For usage of xmms2 cli client see the included manpage and [[Using the application]].

=== What other clients are in progress? ===
* A: See [[XMMS2 Clients]].

=== Does XMMS2 run on my favourite platform/operating system? ===
* A: See the [[Project Status#XMMS2_Platform_Support_Status | Platform support status table]] for an overview. For information about mobile platforms (Palm PDA, Sharp Zaurus, etc), see [[Mobile platforms]].

=== XMMS2 is not working. What should I do? ===
* A: You should do it right, of course. Stop doing it wrong, and it'll start working.
