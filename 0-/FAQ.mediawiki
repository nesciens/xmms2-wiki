'' PLEASE DON'T ADD NEW QUESTIONS HERE, ASK THEM ON THE MAILLIST OR ON IRC! ''

== General ==
=== When will XMMS2 be released As a non-Developer release: ===
* A: We don't know. Probably "when it's done". RSN.

=== What is the difference between MPD (Music Player Daemon) and XMMS2?: ===
* A: See [[XMMS2 vs MPD]]

== Usage ==
'''Hint''': ''Also see the [[Users]] page''

=== How do I use XMMS2? ===
* A: XMMS2 is based on the client-server model, where most of the logic resides inside the server (XMMS2D). With a client, you can send commands to the daemon and play music. For now we only have a commandline client. To install, read the INSTALL file. For usage of xmms2 CLI client see the included manpage and [[Using the application]].

=== What other clients are in progress? ===
* A: See [[XMMS2 Clients]].

=== Does XMMS2 run on my favourite platform/operating system? ===
* A: See the [[Project Status#XMMS2_Platform_Support_Status | Platform support status table]] for an overview. For information about mobile platforms (Palm PDA, Sharp Zaurus, etc), see [[Mobile platforms]].

=== XMMS2 is not working. What should I do? ===
* A: You should do it right, of course. Stop doing it wrong, and it'll start working.

=== While trying to start xmms2, I get ''ERROR: Could not create default configfile!!'' ===
* A: This can happen when you've installed XMMS2 for the first time. You need to run ''xmms2d'' first, then run ''xmms2'' to control the daemon. Running ''xmms2d'' will create the configuration directory as required, so that XMMS2 clients can then create their own configuration files. For more information, please see [[Using the application]].

=== How do I load a playlist? ===
* A: Use the ''addpls'' command of the command line client, for example:

 tru@darkangel:~/xmms2/xmms2$ xmms2 addpls http://www.digitalgunfire.com/playlist.pls
 Added playlist http://www.digitalgunfire.com/playlist.pls
 tru@darkangel:~/xmms2/xmms2$ xmms2 list
 ->[0/30] m - Digital Gunfire (Sweden Mirror) (00:00)
   [1/31]  - Digital Gunfire (Boston Mirror) (00:00)
   [2/32]  - Digital Gunfire (Indiana Mirror) (00:00)

=== When trying to use the xmms2 command line client, I get ''error while loading shared libraries: libxmmsclient.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory'' ===
* A: Add ''/usr/local/lib'' to either your ''LD_LIBRARY_PATH'' environment variable, or as a new line in ''/etc/ld.so.conf''. If you add the line to ld.so.conf, make sure you run ''ldconfig'' before trying to use xmms2 again. If you have installed XMMS2 using a non-default PREFIX, the path you'll have to add will be ''$PREFIX/lib''.

=== Does XMMS2 do crossfading? ===
* A: Not yet, this is a requested feature that might be added in the future.

== Development ==
=== How do I contribute code to XMMS2? ===
* A: Please see the [[Submitting code]] page.

[[Category: Questions and answers]]

=== Why cogito/git? What was wrong with cvs? ===
* A: That's like asking "Why icecream? What was wrong with meatloaf?" when you want a dessert.

=== Why doesn't the CLI client have a play/pause toggle function? ===
* A: The xmms2 command line client exists so as to make most (if not all) the functionality available in the daemon accessible to the user in as simple a way as possible. In this case, simplicity relates to the complexity of the code in the CLI client, not necessarily in terms of usability. While we could bog the client down with various features, we prefer not to do so at the moment. The primary reason for this is that XMMS2 is still under development, and we'd rather focus on the daemon, instead of maintaining a relatively complex client. If you want a client that can toggle between pause and play, please feel free to write your own simple client to do so. (or contribute to an [[XMMS2 Clients | existing client]]) Bugs or feature requests filed about this issue on our bug tracker will promptly be closed as "won't fix" issues. There is a very simple client available on the [[http://exodus.xmms.se/contrib/ contrib page]] that just toggles play/pause.
