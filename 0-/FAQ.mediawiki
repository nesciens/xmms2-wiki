== General ==
=== When will XMMS2 be released As a non-Developer release? ===
* A: We don't know. Probably "when it's done". RSN.

=== What is the difference between MPD (Music Player Daemon) and XMMS2? ===
* A: See [[XMMS2 vs MPD]]

=== Why doesn't XMMS2 use GStreamer? ===
* A: See [[XMMS2 vs GStreamer]]

=== Why doesn't XMMS2 use Dbus? ===
* A: This is really just an implementation detail, everyone should use the clientlib and not have to care about how it talks to the server. It could be using xmlrpc or corba or black magic or smoke signals or jungle bongo drums or morse-over-sigusr1, it is all abstracted away in the client library.

* A2: XMMS2 used to use [[Wikipedia:Dbus | Dbus]] for its client-server communication. It used the peer-to-peer functionality in Dbus, which didn't involve an indirection through a bus. When this mode of operation ceased to be supported, we decided to drop Dbus, as it had caused much trouble chasing an unstable api over which we had no control. There were many other problems as well, such as with the bindings for glib. If Dbus had been as stable as it is today, back then, we might not have switched. However, we would have then been stuck with this extra indirection through the Dbus that doesn't really fit the xmms2 client-server model. 

* A3: XMMS2 is developed with portability in mind. DBus doesn't exist for windows, and it is hard to justify depending on DBus on other unices than Linux too (such as *BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X).

=== Why does XMMS2 require SQLite3 and why is the db backend not selectable? ===
* A: XMMS2 uses SQLite3 for its "[[The Medialib |medialib]]". It will store (cache) metadata from your media files. This will make adding a file to your playlist a lot faster since ''xmms2d'' will not have to open the file and re-read the tags. It also allows you to query the medialib in order to make a selection of songs.
* A2: SQLite3 is very tightly connected to the internals of XMMS2, this will not change since it can create a situation in which certain features and clients will only work with a certain backend. This also means that XMMS2 will never ship a version where the medialib is optional.

== Usage ==
'''Hint''': ''Also see the [[Getting Started]] page''

=== How do I use XMMS2? ===
* A: XMMS2 is based on the client-server model, where most of the logic resides inside the server (XMMS2D). With a client, you can send commands to the daemon and play music. For now we only have a commandline client. To install, read the INSTALL file. For usage of xmms2 CLI client see the included manpage and [[Using the application]].

=== What other clients are in progress? ===
* A: See [[XMMS2 Clients]].

=== Does XMMS2 run on my favourite platform/operating system? ===
* A: See the [[Project Status#XMMS2_Platform_Support_Status | Platform support status table]] for an overview. For information about mobile platforms (Palm PDA, Sharp Zaurus, etc), see [[Mobile platforms]].

=== How do I load a playlist? ===
* A: Use the ''addpls'' command of the command line client, for example:

 tru@darkangel:~/xmms2/xmms2$ xmms2 addpls http://www.digitalgunfire.com/playlist.pls
 Added playlist http://www.digitalgunfire.com/playlist.pls
 tru@darkangel:~/xmms2/xmms2$ xmms2 list
 ->[0/30] m - Digital Gunfire (Sweden Mirror) (00:00)
   [1/31]  - Digital Gunfire (Boston Mirror) (00:00)
   [2/32]  - Digital Gunfire (Indiana Mirror) (00:00)

=== Does XMMS2 do crossfading? ===
* A: Not yet, this is a requested feature that might be added in the future.

== Development ==
=== How do I contribute code to XMMS2? ===
* A: Please see the [[Submitting code]] page.

=== Why cogito/git? What was wrong with cvs? ===
* A: That's like asking "Why icecream? What was wrong with meatloaf?" when you want a dessert.

=== Why doesn't the CLI client have a play/pause toggle function? ===
* A: There is a very simple client available on the [[contribs]] that just toggles play/pause.

== Troubleshooting ==
=== XMMS2 is not working. What should I do? ===
* A: You should do it right, of course. Stop doing it wrong, and it'll start working. No, seriously, see if your problem can be solved below, if not, try the mailing list or IRC. If you run xmms2-launcher or xmms2d, try using the -v option for more output. Remember that the xmms2-launcher program puts all output from the xmms2 daemon into a log file: /tmp/xmms2.log. This output will be very helpful in diagnosing your problems.

=== While trying to start xmms2, I get ''ERROR: Could not create default configfile!!'' ===
* A: This can happen when you've installed XMMS2 for the first time. You need to run ''xmms2d'' or ''xmms2-launcher'' first, then run ''xmms2'' to control the daemon. Running ''xmms2d'' will create the configuration directory as required, so that XMMS2 clients can then create their own configuration files. For more information, please see [[Using the application]].

=== When trying to use the xmms2 command line client, I get ''error while loading shared libraries: libxmmsclient.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory'' ===
* A: Add ''/usr/local/lib'' to either your ''LD_LIBRARY_PATH'' environment variable, or as a new line in ''/etc/ld.so.conf''. If you add the line to ld.so.conf, make sure you run ''ldconfig'' before trying to use xmms2 again. If you have installed XMMS2 using a non-default PREFIX, the path you'll have to add will be ''$PREFIX/lib''.

=== When trying to use a Ruby or Python XMMS2 client, I get ''can't find xmmsclient'' ===
* A: This means you're missing the Ruby or Python client library bindings. To build the Python module, you'll need to install [http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/ Pyrex] and Python dev headers. To build the Ruby module, you'll need to install the Ruby dev headers. Once you have those, run ''scons CONFIG=1'' to re-build XMMS2.

=== I can't play MP3s, what kind of media player is this? ===
* A: XMMS2 only installs plugins for the libraries installed on your system. You're probably missing libmad. See the [http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/index.php/Install_instructions Install Instructions] for more information.

=== I have libmad installed, but I still can't play MP3s, what gives? ===
* A: If you built your copy of xmms2 from source, and especially if you're on a binary distribution like ubuntu or debian, chances are you're missing needed header files. You need to install the -dev package for libmad on your system. This will install the requisite mad.h header file that xmms2 uses to link to the MAD library. Again, see the [http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/index.php/Install_instructions Install Instructions] for more information.

=== When I add my media collection to the playlist, x files don't show up. ===
* A: One cause is that you're missing a plugin required to decode the file. If you notice a certain type of file is missing, such as all your MP3s or Oggs, you should read the [http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/index.php/Install_instructions Install Instructions] or read above for help. This is where your log can come in handy.

* A2: Another possible cause is that your file has an uncommon mix of formats. If you notice that only certain files are missing, such as certain MP3s, this is likely the case. As of this writing, certain MP3s have a [http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/view.php?id=495 known bug] which causes them to fail detection. This type of file is pretty rare, however, so you can probably just hang tight and you won't miss these MP3s too much.

=== When I start xmms2d or xmms2-launcher I get ''ERROR: Couldn't initialize IPC socket'' or ''startup failed!'' ===
* A: There are a few possible causes for this. Check that the user running xmms2d has read/write permission on /tmp. Check that there is no currently-running xmms2d process (''ps ax | grep xmms2d'' should do it). Finally, make sure the ipcsocket in your ~/.xmms2/xmms2.conf is read/writable if you've changed the default IPC socket (unix:///tmp/xmms-ipc-<user>).

=== Help, I found a bug! ===
* A: So, you found a problem that couldn't be solved here. Please read the page on [http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/index.php/Reporting_bugs reporting bugs] then submit a bug report. If you want you can also use IRC or the mailing list to be more interactive with the developers. In either case, you should be sure to check your e-mail and changes on your bug report page regularly and submit any extra information required.

=== Snapshot tarball full of random files and things about 'paxheader' ===
* A: The snapshot tarballs are generated using ''git-tar-tree'' and are ''pax'' format archives with pax extended attributes. If you see *.paxheader and *.data files instead of a normal source tree, you'll need to use a different version of ''tar'' or some other archive extraction utility, such as ''bsdtar'', ''star'', or ''GNU tar''.

=== I added some music and started playing, but I can't hear anything! ===

* A: "Did you try turning it off and on?" This checklist might help:
** 0. Are you deaf?
*# Do you have speakers plugged into your sound output device?
*# Are the speakers turned on?
*# Can other programs output sound properly?
*# Do you have an onboard sound chip (or cheap/old sound card) and some other program is currently using the device?
*# Check your device mixer settings (using alsamixer/kmixer/aumix/something appropriate). Do you have volume set to 0, or have some channels muted?
*# Check the volume setting on the output plugin using ''xmms2 volume_list''.
