Here we collect all information about developing on/against XMMS2. I also store my strange ideas here, if you don't have anything better todo you can always try to comment on them.

First of all, you may want to get to know the XMMS2 design and source:

*[http://xmms2.xmms.se/doxygen/html/index.html Doxygen documentation]
*[[XMMS2 Source Trees]]

Before you start to hack you should also read the documents about [[Using BitKeeper]] and [[XMMS2 Codingstyle]].
