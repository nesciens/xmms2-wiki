If you think you found a bug in XMMS2, please report it to the bugtracker at http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/ (CHECK FOR SIMILAR BUGS FIRST!)

The reason why the bugreporting tool requires you to register an account with a valid email adress is quite simple - we have little to no interest in bugreports from people we can't get hold of for additional information. Complaints about this will fall on deaf ears.

If you encountered a crash:
* Please provide a backtrace.
* Provide the output of xmms2d, which, if you used xmms2-launcher, resides in ''/tmp/xmms2.log''. (See [[Understanding xmms2d output]]) Use the ''-v'' (verbose) option to make xmms2d output more details about what it's doing, for example, ''xmms2d -v'' or ''xmms2-launcher -v''.
* In the bug report, try and clarify what you were doing with XMMS2 when the crash occurred. For example "I added 12 Ogg Vorbis file from /home/bloggs/music/foo/, tried to jump to the 5th song, then XMMS2 crashed."
** In short, try and explain how we can reproduce the bug so we can try to fix it.
* Try and specify which version of XMMS2 you were using. For example, by running ''xmms2d --version'' (example output: ''XMMS version 0.1 DR1.1-WIP (git-commit: d380b65e6c2afa93ec2f6e371b8003455c9db7be)''). You may also specify where you got the source code or binaries from.
* Any extra information about your system setup would be appreciated:
** Operating System (or Linux distribution name and version).
** Version numbers of the tools you used to build XMMS2, if you built from source. (SCons, gcc, pyrex, python, etc)
** Version numbers of library dependencies of XMMS2. (See [[Install instructions#Dependencies | the installation instructions]] for a list of dependencies)
