If you think you found a bug in XMMS2, please report it to the bugtracker at http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/

If you encountered a crash, please also provide a backtrace.

The reason why the bugreporting tool requires you to register an account with a valid email adress is quite simple - we have little to no interest in bugreports from people we can't get hold of for additional information. Complaints about this will fall on deaf ears.
