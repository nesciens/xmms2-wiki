If you think you found a bug in XMMS2, please report it to the bugtracker at http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/

The reason why the bugreporting tool requires you to register an account with a valid email adress is quite simple - we have little to no interest in bugreports from people we can't get hold of for additional information. Complaints about this will fall on deaf ears.

If you encountered a crash:
* please provide a backtrace.
* provide the contents of the xmms2d log file, typically ''/tmp/xmmsd.<timestamp>'', where ''<timestamp>'' is the time at which xmms2d was started, in UNIX format (seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970). An example would be ''/tmp/xmmsd.1116742525''.
** The log file may be named ''xmmsd.<iso8601 date>.<hour><minutes><seconds>'' instead, for example, ''xmmsd.2005-05-22.182805'' if the daemon was started at 18:28:05 on 22 May 2005.
