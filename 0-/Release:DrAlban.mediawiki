'''Developer Release 3''' is the third major developer release of XMMS 2 code. What it means:

* Make adjustments in the API according to needs of new plugins/clients. Hopefully these are very minor (or totally non-existent if we are lucky)
* Fix bugs
* Add tons with new bugs and new features that will make xmms2 crash in exciting new ways.

== To Do ==

=== Likely ===
* provide wave-data for vis-clients, not just frequency-data. {{Bug|192}}
** DR3?
* Allow open/init in output-plugins to fail. And make open in oss/alsa non blocking. Report error accordingly. {{Bug|191}}
** I really want this for DR2
* Fix/investigate config system {{Bug|99}}, {{Bug|97}}, {{Bug|19}}
** Hmm. I should really do this for DR2
* Add support for multiple IPC sockets {{Bug|89}}
** DR3?
* write a bunch of test scripts, optionally with a set of test sound samples.
** DR3?
** maybe this should be kept separate from the main tree? the sound samples, especially, could be quite large.
*** Yes this should definitely be a separate repository, where testing procedures are defined and media files for testing and scripts to do automatic testing are available for download.

=== Unlikely ===
* Have a good method for building out-of-tree (third party) plugins.
* ''maybe'' get some more plugins in. :P
** Ogg -> flac, vorbis
** MKA
* DAAP?
** transport plugin? (XMMS2 as client) client should be able to browse DAAP shares and add daap:// urls, perhaps.
** <strike>effect plugin? (XMMS2 as daemon)</strike>. Way better left to a dedicated DAAP daemon; daapd.
** [[Music Sharing]]


== Done ==
* change mime type handling {{Bug|65}} (see bug notes)
* Make medialib async for internal callers {{Bug|190}}
