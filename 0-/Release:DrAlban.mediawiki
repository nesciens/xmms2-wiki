'''Developer Release 3''' is the third major developer release of XMMS 2 code. What it means:

* Make adjustments in the API according to needs of new plugins/clients. Hopefully these are very minor (or totally non-existent if we are lucky)
* Fix bugs
* Add tons with new bugs and new features that will make xmms2 crash in exciting new ways.


= Release notes =
XMMS2 Team releases a new Developer Release to the wild, named DR-Alban. This
file documents the changes between DR2.2 and DR-Alban.

==Versioning==
During the process of DR2.2 we decided to change the [[versioning]]. We now
name our Developer Release after known "Doctors". Former pre-DR3 has
become DRAlban and DR3 will be DR-FeelGood.

==Noteworthy feature additions==
=== {{Bug|273}}: Added AAC/MP4 plugin ===
Juho VÃ¤hÃ¤-Herttua contributed a AAC/MP4 plugin based on libfaad.

=== {{Bug|428}}: Added MusePack Plugin ===
Daniel Svensson contributed a MusePack plugin.

=== {{Bug|65}}: Add new magic code. ===
Tilman Sauerbeck added magic recognition of mediafiles. This removes
the old and stupid recognition scheme (look at the extension) and
now we try to identify which plugin should handle a file via content
recognition.

=== {{Bug|276}}: Add xmms2-launcher program. ===
Anders Gustafsson removed the deamonisation from XMMS2D. You now use
xmms2-launcher to put xmms2d in the background.

=== {{Bug|190}}: Remove gigantic SQLite3 lock. ===
Tobias RundstrÃ¶m removed the gigantic SQLite lock. We can now have
concurrent SQLite connection at the same time. Will improve preformance for
most operations. Please note that old SQLite3 versions can be buggy with
this change. Make sure you are using SQLite version 3.2.6 or higher.

=== {{Bug|282}}: Added support for writing data to medialib from clients. ===
Tobias RundstrÃ¶m also added support to write data to the medialib from
clients. You can now associate own values with entries in the medialib.
Opens a lot of new functionallity for clients.

== Noteworthy bug fixes ==
Both ringbuffer and transport code got a lot of eyes during this release.
This should eliminate a lot of problems with deadlocking and timing
problems during playback and seeking.

{{Bug|334}}:Fixed noise in Jack plugin.
Our Jack output plugin maintainer Chris Morgan fixed a lot of problems with
the Jack plugin.

Another 50 bugs has been squished and stability should really improve with
this release.

== Notes to client authors ==
This release will break all exsisting APIs. You need to rework your clients
to handle sources and some other minor changes.

== Notes to users ==
This release will remove your medialib. Make a backup if you want to keep
information in there.

== Thanks ==
Lot of new developers has joined up with XMMS2 team during this period.
Thanks for all support and help.

== To Do ==

See {{Bug|317}} for a list of bugs that are related to DR3.

=== Likely ===
* provide wave-data for vis-clients, not just frequency-data. {{Bug|192}}
** DR3?
* Allow open/init in output-plugins to fail. And make open in oss/alsa non blocking. Report error accordingly. {{Bug|191}}
** I really want this for DR2
* Fix/investigate config system {{Bug|99}}, {{Bug|97}}, {{Bug|19}}
** Hmm. I should really do this for DR2
* Add support for multiple IPC sockets {{Bug|89}}
** DR3?
* write a bunch of test scripts, optionally with a set of test sound samples.
** DR3?
** maybe this should be kept separate from the main tree? the sound samples, especially, could be quite large.
*** Yes this should definitely be a separate repository, where testing procedures are defined and media files for testing and scripts to do automatic testing are available for download.

=== Unlikely ===
* Have a good method for building out-of-tree (third party) plugins.
* ''maybe'' get some more plugins in. :P
** Ogg -> flac, vorbis
** MKA
* DAAP?
** transport plugin? (XMMS2 as client) client should be able to browse DAAP shares and add daap:// urls, perhaps.
** <strike>effect plugin? (XMMS2 as daemon)</strike>. Way better left to a dedicated DAAP daemon; daapd.
** [[Music Sharing]]


== Done ==
* change mime type handling {{Bug|65}} (see bug notes)
* Make medialib async for internal callers {{Bug|190}}
