xmms2d can be started by either typing 'xmms2d' after installing the application or trying perform some action with 'xmms2'.

 xmms2d
 xmms2 add some.nice.music.ogg
 xmms2 play

Tada, music!

If this doesn't work you can probably figure out what the problem is from the server log, most likely it's because you don't have permission to access the soundcard device(s) or you are using the wrong output plugin. The latter can be changed with:

 xmms2 config output.plugin oss-or-alsa-or-whatever-plugin-you-should-use
 xmms2 quit

Start xmms2d again and now it should work.

Type 'xmms2' to list the available commands.

== xmms2d options ==

Here is a list of currently available xmms2d options:

* -v - Increase verbosity
* -V - Show XMMS2 version
* -n - Disable logging
* -o - Specify output plugin
* -d - Daemonize, that is, run xmms2d without attaching it to a terminal
* -p - Specify plugin path

If you want xmms2d to listen for requests via TCP you should alter the config. 

 xmms2 config core.ipcsocket tcp://0:<port> 

and then restart xmms2d. Now xmms2d will listen to that port for incoming remote clients.

== xmms2 client options ==

The basic CLI (command line interface) xmms2 client can use alternative paths for IPC. Simply set the XMMS_PATH environment variable to the appropriate path and then use the client.

Alternative Unix socket path (using Bash shell):

  XMMS_PATH="unix:///tmp/my-socket" xmms2 list

equivalent:

  export XMMS_PATH="unix:///tmp/my-socket"
  xmms2 list

Talking to the daemon via TCP (Note: this example is for the daemon listening to port 7777 on a machine with address 10.0.0.1 This does not imply port 7777 is the default TCP port):

  export XMMS_PATH="tcp://10.0.0.1:7777"
  xmms2 list

== First steps using xmms2 client ==

Add all files in a directory to the playlist (recursively adds files in subdirectories as well):

  xmms2 radd /path/to/music

Play:

  xmms2 play

Query the medialib database (e.g. your favourite band):

  xmms2 mlib query "select * from Media where artist = 'Korn' order by album"
