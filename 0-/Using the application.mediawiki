Please also view the manual pages. If you have the XMMS2 source they're in doc/xmms2.1 and doc/xmms2d.8. A patch is in the works to actually install them. They can also be viewed at [[http://alex.complete-systems.net/manpages.html http://alex.complete-systems.net/manpages.html]].


xmms2d can be started by typing 'xmms2d' after installing the application. You can then interact with the daemon using the 'xmms2' command-line client.

 xmms2d
 xmms2 add some.nice.music.ogg
 xmms2 play

Tada, music!

If this doesn't work you can probably figure out what the problem is from the server log, most likely it's because you don't have permission to access the soundcard device(s) or you are using the wrong output plugin. The latter can be changed with:

 xmms2 config output.plugin oss-or-alsa-or-whatever-plugin-you-should-use
 xmms2 quit

Start xmms2d again and now it should work.

Type 'xmms2' to list the available commands.

== xmms2d options ==

Here is a list of currently available xmms2d options:

* -v - Increase verbosity
* -V (or --version) - Show XMMS2 version
* -n - Disable logging
* -o <x> - Specify <x> as output plugin
* -d - Daemonize, that is, run xmms2d without attaching it to a terminal
* -p <path> - Specify plugin directory path
* -h (or --help) - Print help (show list of options)
* -c (or --conf) - Specify alternate configuration file

If you want xmms2d to listen for requests via TCP you should alter the config. 

 xmms2 config core.ipcsocket tcp://127.0.0.1:<port> 

and then restart xmms2d. Now xmms2d will listen to that port for incoming remote clients.

== xmms2 client options ==

The basic CLI (command line interface) xmms2 client can use alternative paths for IPC. Simply set the XMMS_PATH environment variable to the appropriate path and then use the client.

Alternative Unix socket path (using Bash shell):

  XMMS_PATH="unix:///tmp/my-socket" xmms2 list

equivalent:

  export XMMS_PATH="unix:///tmp/my-socket"
  xmms2 list

for (t)csh users:

  setenv XMMS_PATH "unix:///tmp/my-socket"
  xmms2 list

Talking to the daemon via TCP (Note: this example is for the daemon listening to port 7777 on a machine with address 10.0.0.1 This does not imply port 7777 is the default TCP port):

  export XMMS_PATH="tcp://10.0.0.1:7777"
  xmms2 list

for (t)csh use setenv and do not include the =.

== First steps using xmms2 client ==

Add all files in a directory to the medialib (recursively adds files in subdirectories as well):

  xmms2 mlib addpath /path/to/music

Add files to the playlist:

  xmms2 add /some/path/*.ogg

Play:

  xmms2 play

Query the medialib database (e.g. your favourite band):

  xmms2 mlib search artist="Kultiration"

Query the medialib database and add the result to your playlist:

  xmms2 mlib searchadd artist="Kultiration"

Listen to a shoutcast stream (assuming curl plugin is installed and playlist is empty):

  xmms2 mlib import_playlist bluemars http://207.200.96.225:8020/listen.pls
  xmms2 mlib load_playlist bluemars
  xmms2 play

Or with the direct url:

  xmms2 add http://207.200.96.225:8020
  xmms2 play
