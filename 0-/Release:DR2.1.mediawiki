This is a maintenance release, fixing bugs found in [[Release:DR2]].

= Release notes =

Good news everyone! XMMS2 Team is releasing a bugfix release of the current DR (Developer Release) called DR2.1. This corrects some annoyances found by the community. Most outstanding was a ID3v2.3 parsing error.

This release is compatible with DR2 and will not break API, medialib or client communication (we think).

We are now focusing on the last DR. Work has started in the devel branch. The planned features/changes are colleted under {{Bug|317}} and the commits could be viewed here: http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-devel.git;a=summary. Your feedback is important for DR3 since we are aiming to stablize the API after this.

Source is available at sourceforge as usual.

Now have a nice day!
