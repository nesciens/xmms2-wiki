Note that this page refers to the XMMS2 XCode port that tries to make XMMS2 better compatible Mac OS X.

== Goals ==
To create tools for building XMMS2 with the Mac OS X tools. For better integration with Mac OS X and the iPhone. This should also make it easier for people that want to create Cocoa clients.


== Building/Hacking ==
# Install XCode
# Install macports (make sure they are installed in /opt/local)
# install git, glib2, libmad, libvorbis
# Checkout the code
## git clone git.xmms2.org:/xmms2/macosx/build.git
## cd build.git
## git clone git.xmms2.org:/xmms2/xmms2-tru.git#macbuild xmms2
## git clone git.xmms2.org:/xmms2/macosx/xmmsclient-objc.git
# Open xmms2-macbuild.xcodeproj in XCode
# Build

This should build xmms2d, xmmsclient.framework, xmmsclient++.framework and xmmsclient-objc.framework

== TODO List ==
* Make XMMS2 build with XCode - *works*
* Make it easier to bundle xmms2d with an .APP bundle
