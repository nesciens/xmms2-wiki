'''Note''': you should read the [[Install instructions]] page as well.

== Source ==
* Look at our sourceforge page for releases: http://sf.net/projects/xmms2
* The GIT repository (with snapshots) is viewable at: http://git.xmms.se

About the GIT repository: You would usually want code from the ''xmms2-stable.git'' tree.

== Binary Packages ==

=== Debian ===
 deb http://exodus.xmms.se/debian stable main

These packages are built for ''Debian sarge'' (the current stable release) but work on ''Debian sid'' just as well.  Use of the packages on Debian-based distributions such as ''Ubuntu'' is untested as of yet.  We would like to hear your reports.

<small>Debian packages can be built using the source tree by using ''dpkg-buildpackage''. See the [[Install instructions | installation instructions]] and Debian packaging documentation for more information. '''Important''' note: the Debian package-building process for XMMS2 is set up so as to build '''everything''', and may require lots of dependencies - for most users, the pre-built packages should be sufficient.</small>

A FreeBSD Port is avaliable at http://www.stampede.org/~drax/xmms2-port.shar
