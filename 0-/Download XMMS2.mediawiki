Lately ebuilds for XMMS2, [http://xmms2.org/wiki/Client:XMMS2-Scrobbler xmms2-scrobbler] and [http://xmms2.org/wiki/Client:LXMusic LXMmusic] were added to portage. To install:
 emerge xmms2
 emerge xmms2-scrobbler
 emerge lxmusic

As XMMS2 has a lot of USE-flags, you would want first to check them (and dependencies according to them), so you can set them before installation:
 equery u xmms2
 equery g xmms2

For more clients you would need to [http://gpo.zugaina.org/Search?search=xmms2 check] custom overlays, but instead of adding them i would suggest just using ebuild for specific client you want.


== Windows ==
Getting XMMS2 to build/run on Windows is mostly working, but not all features of XMMS2 are currently available on Windows, and some plugins are missing/broken. Also note that these packages have not been thoroughly tested by the XMMS2 team. See also: [[Windows]].

== Mac OS X ==

; MacPorts
xmms2 is included in [http://www.macports.org MacPorts], however the port does not allow to customize the installation via variants at the moment. To include optional features, required libraries need to be installed beforehand. To install:
 sudo port install xmms2


To have more control over the feature-set, download the source and configure xmms2 manually:
 ./waf configure --prefix=/opt/local --conf-prefix=/opt/local --nocache

And then:
 ./waf build && ./waf install

xmms2 is now included in the FreeBSD ports tree. It can be found in audio/xmms2.
