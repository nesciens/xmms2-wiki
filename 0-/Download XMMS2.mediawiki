'''Note''': you should read the [[Install instructions]] page as well.

== Source ==
* Look at our sourceforge page for releases: http://sf.net/projects/xmms2
* The GIT repository (with snapshots) is viewable at: http://git.xmms.se

About the GIT repository: You would usually want code from the ''xmms2-stable.git'' tree. The latest (possibly unstable and buggy) code is in the ''xmms2-devel.git'' tree.

== Binary Packages ==

=== Debian ===
 deb http://exodus.xmms.se/debian stable main

These packages are built for ''Debian sarge'' (the current stable release) but work on ''Debian sid'' just as well.  Use of the packages on most Debian-based distributions is untested as of yet, though ''Ubuntu 5.10'' appears to work.  We would like to hear your reports.

<small>Debian packages can be built using the source tree by using ''dpkg-buildpackage''. See the [[Install instructions | installation instructions]] and Debian packaging documentation for more information. '''Important''' note: the Debian package-building process for XMMS2 is set up so as to build '''everything''', and may require lots of dependencies - for most users, the pre-built packages should be sufficient.</small>

=== Ubuntu ===
==== Breezy Badger ====
The Debian packages appear to work on ''Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger'', but have yet to be tested thoroughly.
Add the following line to your ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' (same line as debian above):
 deb http://exodus.xmms.se/debian stable main

Open Synaptic, go to ''Edit->Reload Package Information'', then install xmms2.  You'll probably also want the decoder plugins ''xmms2-decoder-mad'' (for MP3) and ''xmms2-decoder-vorbis'' (Ogg Vorbis).

==== Drapper Drake ====
Packages is built specificly for Drapper are available:
 deb http://exodus.xmms.se/debian drapper main

== Ports ==

=== FreeBSD ===
xmms2 is now included in the FreeBSD ports tree. It can be found in audio/xmms2.

=== NetBSD ===
A xmms2 pkgsrc package for NetBSD and other operating systems supported by pkgsrc is available at http://pkgsrc-wip.sourceforge.net/.

=== CRUX ===
Rugek has a port repository with Xmms2 here: http://rugek.dirtyhack.net/crux-ports/rugek.httpup

=== Arch Linux ===
xmms2 snapshots and gxmms2 are avaiable through AUR

=== Gentoo Linux ===
Note: There is some faad2 breakage in Gentoo. None of the following ebuilds depend on faad2, but they may still pick it up if already installed. (Which is horribly bad.)

Some ebuilds are available here: [http://www.zugaina.org/gentoo/media-sound.html.en Ycarus ebuilds]

There's another set of ebuilds available at: http://stuge.se/gentoo/

These ebuilds have more USE flags for the optional packages that xmms2 can depend on but does not strictly require in order to compile. The 0.2 DrAlban ebuild also has a new local "phonehome" USE flag that has to be set in order to enable the xmms2-et client that phones home to the developers. (xmms2-et is enabled by default in DrAlban everywhere else)

There are plans to add xmms2 to Gentoo in the near future. You can track the progress at http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93583
