'''Note''': you should read the [[Install instructions]] page as well.

== Source ==
* Look at our sourceforge page for releases: http://sf.net/projects/xmms2
* The GIT repository (with snapshots) is viewable at: http://git.xmms.se

About the GIT repository: You would usually want code from the ''xmms2-stable.git'' tree. The latest (possibly unstable and buggy) code is in the ''xmms2-devel.git'' tree.

== Binary Packages ==

=== Debian ===
 deb http://exodus.xmms.se/debian stable main

These packages are built for ''Debian sarge'' (the current stable release) but work on ''Debian sid'' just as well.  Use of the packages on most Debian-based distributions is untested as of yet, though ''Ubuntu 5.10'' appears to work.  We would like to hear your reports.

<small>Debian packages can be built using the source tree by using ''dpkg-buildpackage''. See the [[Install instructions | installation instructions]] and Debian packaging documentation for more information. '''Important''' note: the Debian package-building process for XMMS2 is set up so as to build '''everything''', and may require lots of dependencies - for most users, the pre-built packages should be sufficient.</small>

=== Ubuntu ===
The Debian packages appear to work on ''Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger'', but have yet to be tested thoroughly.
Add the following line to your ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' (same line as debian above):
 deb http://exodus.xmms.se/debian stable main

Open Synaptic, go to ''Edit->Reload Package Information'', then install xmms2.  You'll probably also want the decoder plugins ''xmms2-decoder-mad'' (for MP3) and ''xmms2-decoder-vorbis'' (OGG).

== Ports ==

xmms2 is now included in the FreeBSD ports tree. It can be found in audio/xmms2.
