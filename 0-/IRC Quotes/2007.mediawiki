 [22:55:51][tilman]: we used bk and people used it even if it's non-free software
 [22:56:07][tilman]: now we're prolly gonna use a free scm and people bitch because it requires free software?

 17:25 <nano> DraX: You BSD dudes seem to get confused on feature completeness vs bloat all the
             time.

 22:42 <tru> anders: do you want to review or should we push it to master and let nano and 
             eleusis find the problems? ;)
 22:42 <anders> lol.
 22:43 <anders> xmms2 development process: patches can be reviewed in two ways; (1) anders looks at it
               and always biches as hell, (2) it's pushed to master anyway and nano and eleusis finds
               the bugs.
