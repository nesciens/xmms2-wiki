 16:07 <ccr> I don't know about you, but some people really do have too much time ... and I'm certain they're stealing that time from me.

 [04:34:28][smallfoot-]: hehe
 [04:37:40][smallfoot-]: i saw wiki of xmms2
 [04:37:48][smallfoot-]: it shows some api to use
 [04:37:57][smallfoot-]: but it doesnt show the protocol
 [04:38:04][smallfoot-]: i think a XML based protocol would be neat
 [04:38:18][jmsaunders]: I have a friend who despises XML
 [04:38:36][smallfoot-]: why
 [04:38:41][jmsaunders]: I'm not really sure
 [04:38:51][smallfoot-]: sure its a little overhead, but its greatly extensible

Note: Yes the above is a funny because the guy has NO idea of what he is talking about.. No we do not intend to support an XML API for a application that needs to rapidly update a lot of clients. A little overhead? heh.

 18:45 <shdf> tru: hopefully your player will become superior =)
 18:46 <eleusis> i'm not sure what the metric for 'superior' music player is..
 18:48 <shdf> eleusis: for me it's something like: quicktime < realplayer < win media player < mpg123 <

 [22:55:51][tilman]: we used bk and people used it even if it's non-free software
 [22:56:07][tilman]: now we're prolly gonna use a free scm and people bitch because it requires free software?

 17:25 <nano> DraX: You BSD dudes seem to get confused on feature completeness vs bloat all the
             time.

 22:42 <tru> anders: do you want to review or should we push it to master and let nano and 
             eleusis find the problems? ;)
 22:42 <anders> lol.
 22:43 <anders> xmms2 development process: patches can be reviewed in two ways; (1) anders looks at it
               and always biches as hell, (2) it's pushed to master anyway and nano and eleusis finds
               the bugs.
