 11:26 <sofciq> can anyone tell me what may be wrong if I get an error like this 
                when I try to run Euphoria: /euphoria:12:in `require': No such file 
               to load -- xmmsclient (LoadError)
 11:26 <sofciq>         from ./euphoria:12
 11:26 <sofciq>  ?
 11:27 <tru> you don't have ruby bindings for xmmsclient.
 11:27 <sofciq> xmms2 itself run from from the command line works fine
 11:27 <eleusis> you may not have the ruby bindings installed
 11:27 <optical> looks like the ruby bindings is not installed
 11:27 <optical> heh
 11:27 <tru> let's say it all again!
 11:27 <eleusis> ok, ready?
 11:27 <optical> go!
 11:28 <eleusis> 1.. 2.. 3..
 11:28 <eleusis> you may not have the ruby bindings installed
 11:28 <tru> you don't have ruby bindings for xmmsclient.
 11:28 <optical> sofciq: do you have the ruby bindings installed?

=== 2005-07-22 - Straight as a curve ===
 23:20 <tru> it was a gay bug.
 23:20 <tru> but I fixed it.
 23:22 <DraX> you're like one of those scary camps scary christian parents send
              their kids to try and make them straight :P

=== 2005-07-11 - Yes we like ALL of you! ===

 10:48 <puzzles> i don't even know what a mutex is
 10:48 <tru> a lock.
 10:49 <puzzles> well then i don't know what a lock is :)
 10:49 <juhovh> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion
 10:49 <[Peter]> it's like the one you have on your toilet door. You don't want 
                 anyone to go and take a shit at the same time as you

=== 2005-07-06 - We know where the fulkod is. ===
 09:24 <eleusis> with xmms2d -d, if the process aborts due to this log init 
                assertion failure, the process hangs :P
 09:25 <eleusis> i think the daemonisation sequence should really be improved 
                soon ;)
 09:25 <tru> I think the whole init process and forking thing is quite ugly.
 09:25 <anders_> The whole daemonization-stuff should be fixed.

 16:07 <ccr> I don't know about you, but some people really do have too much time ... 
             and I'm certain they're stealing that time from me.

 [04:34:28][smallfoot-]: hehe
 [04:37:40][smallfoot-]: i saw wiki of xmms2
 [04:37:48][smallfoot-]: it shows some api to use
 [04:37:57][smallfoot-]: but it doesnt show the protocol
 [04:38:04][smallfoot-]: i think a XML based protocol would be neat
 [04:38:18][jmsaunders]: I have a friend who despises XML
 [04:38:36][smallfoot-]: why
 [04:38:41][jmsaunders]: I'm not really sure
 [04:38:51][smallfoot-]: sure its a little overhead, but its greatly extensible

 18:45 <shdf> tru: hopefully your player will become superior =)
 18:46 <eleusis> i'm not sure what the metric for 'superior' music player is..
 18:48 <shdf> eleusis: for me it's something like: quicktime < realplayer < win media player < mpg123 <
             xmms :)

 22:42 <tru> anders: do you want to review or should we push it to master and let nano and 
             eleusis find the problems? ;)
 22:42 <anders> lol.
 22:43 <anders> xmms2 development process: patches can be reviewed in two ways; (1) anders looks at it
               and always biches as hell, (2) it's pushed to master anyway and nano and eleusis finds
               the bugs.
