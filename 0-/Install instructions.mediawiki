== Obtaining the source ==

XMMS2 has still not been released to the public, thus there are no binaries or released source packages. You can download daily repository snapshots from [http://xmms2.xmms.org/snapshots/ the snapshot page] or directly via BitKeeper by running ''bk clone bk://xmms2.xmms.se:5555/xmms2''. For more info about BitKeeper, please see the [[Using BitKeeper]] page.

== Dependencies ==

You will '''need''' the following things to build XMMS2.

* [http://www.python.org/ Python] / [http://www.scons.org/ SCons].
* [http://www.gtk.org/ GLib]
* [http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/ MAD]
* [http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ DBus] (>= 0.22)
* [http://www.sqlite.org SQLite] (2.8.x)

These libraries are not '''needed''' but probably a good idea.

* [http://curl.haxx.se Curl]
* [http://www.xiph.org Vorbisfile]
* [http://www.alsa-project.org ALSA]
* [http://sidplay2.sourceforge.net/ SIDplay2]
* [http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/resid/ reSID]

== Compiling ==

Run ''scons'' to first run the configuration. Tweak the options until you are satisfied. Then run ''scons NOCACHE=1''.

== Installing ==

Run ''scons <prefix>'' to install XMMS2. Where prefix is usually /usr/local.

== Cleaning up ==

''scons -c'' will clean the objects and binaries.

== Uninstalling ==
''scons -c /path/'' will uninstall any files installed under /path
For example, if you installed xmms2 under /usr/local (default), run ''scons -c /usr/local''
