== Obtaining the source ==

XMMS2 has still not been released to the public, thus there are no binaries or released source packages. You can download daily repository snapshots from [http://xmms2.xmms.org/snapshots/ the snapshot page] or directly via BitKeeper by running ''bk clone bk://xmms2.xmms.se:5555/xmms2''. For more info about BitKeeper, please see the [[Using BitKeeper]] page.

== Dependencies ==

You will '''need''' the following things to build XMMS2.

* [http://www.python.org/ Python] (>=2.2.1)/ [http://www.scons.org/ SCons]. (>= 0.94)
* [http://www.gtk.org/ GLib] (>= 2.2.0)
* [http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/ MAD]
* [http://www.sqlite.org SQLite] (3.2.x)


These libraries are not '''needed''' but probably a good idea.

* [http://curl.haxx.se Curl] (>= 7.11.2)
* [http://www.xiph.org Vorbisfile]
* [http://www.alsa-project.org ALSA]
* [http://sidplay2.sourceforge.net/ SIDplay2]
* [http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/resid/ reSID]
* [http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/ Pyrex] - For python bindings.
* [http://www.ruby-lang.org/ Ruby] (>= 1.8) - For Ruby bindings.

== Configuring ==
Run ''scons'' to first run the configuration. Tweak the options, running ''scons NOCACHE=1'' each time till satisfied. You can exclude certain optional modules by running ''scons EXCLUDE="module1 module2 module3"'' where module names are configuration groups listed in ''xmmsconf.py''. (Sorry, there is currently no user-friendly way of listing the modules)

== Compiling ==
Simply run ''scons'' to compile, or ''scons PREFIX=/some/custom/path'' if you plan on installing XMMS2 in ''/some/custom/path''.

== Installing ==

run ''scons install'' to install packages to their default path. you can also install it to a non standard path by adding the PREFIX option to scons. like this:

 scons PREFIX=/usr/local/xmms
 scons PREFIX=/usr/local/xmms install

== Cleaning up ==

''scons -c'' will clean the objects and binaries.

== Uninstalling ==
''scons -c /path/'' will uninstall any files installed under /path
For example, if you installed xmms2 under /usr/local (default), run ''scons -c /usr/local''
