== Obtaining the source ==

XMMS2 is still not released to the public, thus are there no binaries or relased sources. You can download daily snapshots at [http://xmms2.xmms.org/snapshots/ the snapshot page] or directly with BitKeeper by running ''bk clone bk://xmms2.xmms.org:5555/xmms2''.

== Dependencies ==

You will '''need''' the following things to build XMMS2.

* [http://www.python.org/ Python] / [http://www.scons.org/ SCons].
* [http://www.gtk.org/ GLib]
* [http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/ MAD]
* [http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ DBus]
* [http://www.sqlite.org SQLite]

These libraries are not '''needed''' but probably a good idea.

* [http://curl.haxx.se Curl]
* [http://www.xiph.org Vorbisfile]
* [http://www.alsa-project.org ALSA]
* [http://sidplay2.sourceforge.net/ SIDplay2]
* [http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/resid/ reSID]

== Compiling ==

Run ''scons'' to first run the configuration. Tweak the options until you are satisfied. Then run ''scons'' again.

== Installing ==

Run ''scons <prefix>'' to install XMMS2. Where prefix is usually /usr/local.

== Cleaning up ==

''scons -c'' will clean the objects and binaries.
