There is currently no official XMMS2 logo, so you are welcome to have a go at making one. :)

=== Note about submissions ===
To submit a logo, you may edit this wiki page to link to your proposal(s). However, it is '''important''' that you [[About#Contact_info | contact us]], or at least leave your contact details! This way, we'll be able to credit your work properly, or work more closely together to design a logo. Thanks. :)
