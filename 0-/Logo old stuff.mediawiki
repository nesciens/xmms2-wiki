There is currently no official XMMS2 logo, so you are welcome to have a go at making one. :)

=== Logo guidelines (a.k.a: what do we want?) ===
An XMMS2 logo should be futuristic, cool and stylish. Not plotted with detail but clean. It should not feel like XMMS with just a 2 slapped on there. XMMS2 is a completely new codebase and does not have much to do with the old XMMS.

* Logo has to be vectorised.
* Logo (or parts of) has to work as a 32x32 icon.
* Logo has to work on homepage, tshirts, giveaways whatever. :)
* Logo should have a low number of colours, like two or three. (or even only black) This is simply to make sure that the logo looks good with few colours (e.g. some icons). Feel free to submit logos in 'full-colour' versions with equivalent 'low-colour' versions.

=== Note about submissions ===
To submit a logo, you may edit this wiki page to link to your proposal(s). However, it is '''important''' that you [[About#Contact_info | contact us]], or at least leave your contact details! This way, we'll be able to credit your work properly, or work more closely together to design a logo. Thanks. :)
