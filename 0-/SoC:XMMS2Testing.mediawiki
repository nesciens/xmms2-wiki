=Introduction=

Aim of the project is to develop a testing framework using the xUnit (Unit Testing family of approaches) to make test cases against which XMMS2 code could be tested. It has to facilitate easy and effective maintenance of test cases, selection of test cases and suites to run, producing output in a format to enable interface to the external applications, for instance automated update of Wiki Pages for the status of test runs against XMMS2 Code.

==Significance==

It will assist developers to validate the code and functionality in an automated way. Any changed code will be tested by re-executing the test cases. Such avoids considerable regression and assists to validate the functionality. Modular approach and interactive run will make it easier to add/delete/edit test cases. 

Apart from this, the project intends to provide recommendations for the development workflow to maintain test suites. This includes maintaining a proper versioning mechanism for maintaining test cases for various versions of code and validity results.
