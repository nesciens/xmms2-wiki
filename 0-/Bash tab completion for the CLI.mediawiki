xmms2 mlib searchadd artist=the<tab> 

Then some bash completion magic would do

  $ xmms2 mlib query "select value from Media where key='artist' and value like 'the%' 
    group by lower(value) order by lower(value)"|cut -c 9-
  The chemical brothers
  The KLF
  the knife
  The Mitchell Bros.

And then present the alternatives and let the user press tab to select the correct one. Perhaps warn if the result is very big.


Places that would benefit of tab completion


  $ xmms2 config out<tab> 
by values from xmms2 configlist|grep 'out'


  $ xmms2 jump the<tab> 
by values from xmms2 list|grep name, and translate to playlist id on exec (is this possible?)


(if above is possible)
  $ xmms2 addid the<tab>
by values from a xmms2 mlib query and translate to medialib id on exec


  $ xmms2 sort a<tab>
by some predefined values, artist, title, duration, album etc etc
