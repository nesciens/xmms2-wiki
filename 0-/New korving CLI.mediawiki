This page is for discussion of a new potential CLI client for XMMS2.

== requested features ==

* scripting/alias support
** alias dis="clear;mlib search artist:dismantled;play"
* shell functionality (including clever completion)
* depending calls
** mlib search artist:foobar; add (will search after foobar and add without arguments will use the last returned list)
* pipe support
** cat file.m3u | xmms2 add
* better argument parsing
** xmms2 add -p playlist <files>
* short commands
** either as default completion ("ju" matches only "jump") or using chosen one- or two-letter shortcuts (e.g. 't' == "status")

== Requirements ==
* minimal dependency, glib and readline? (maybe libedit, seems more sane than readline)
* have some compatibility with old cli but not to death either.
