== Why is XMMS2? ==

This is one of the fundamental questions concerning XMMS2-project as whole. Why bother to work on a next generation XMMS while there are various existing and more advanced projects already in progress, some ready for production use?

Question is inherently complicated and thus is the answer too. XMMS2 as a project had been cooking for a long, long time, before GStreamer, MusicPD or similar projects had started. Need for XMMS1 replacement has been evident for years, current codebase and framework wasn't exactly well-designed from beginning. Lately XMMS1 hasn't been actively developed further, which can be attributed to lack of active developers, but also to broken codebase. Adding new features is bulky, some of the most wanted ones would be near impossible to add. Some parts of XMMS1 are beyond patching, re-writing of the framework was needed.

As the years went by, GStreamer was born - a generic multimedia framework with lots of flexible modularity and extensible plugin-architehcture. GStreamer is an interesting concept, but XMMS, despite the name, was never meant to be a generic multimedia player. XMMS has always essentially been audio player, the video-plugins were just ugly glue for technical experimentation.

== What is XMMS2? ==

Being namely the descendant of XMMS and especially marked second generation, people will have all kinds of expectations what XMMS2 will and will not be. I'll first list the whats and whatnots shortly and explain the reasons more thoroughly afterwards.

- XMMS2 is a music player, it plays audio.

- XMMS2 is not a video player.

- XMMS2 does have a GUI, but it is not integrated. Instead we talk about clients, and there can be many clients connected to the daemon.

- There will be one "official" GUI client and one "official" commandline client.

- ----

So, XMMS2 is definitely an audio player. But it is not a multimedia player, it will not play videos. It has a modular framework and plugin-architechture for audio processing, visualization and output, but this framework has not been designed to support video. Also the daemon/client-type design of XMMS2 (and the daemon being independent of any graphics output) practically prevents video output being implemented. Reasons for this have been stated in above chapter (Why is XMMS2?)
