''Unfortunately, no one can be told what XMMS2 is. You have to see it for yourself.''

== Why XMMS2? ==

This is one of the fundamental questions concerning the XMMS2 project as whole. Why bother working on a next generation XMMS while there are various existing and more advanced projects already in progress, some ready for production use?

The question is inherently complicated and so is the answer. XMMS2 as a project had been cooking for a long, long time before [http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/ GStreamer], [http://musicpd.org MusicPD] or similar projects started. The need for an XMMS1 replacement had been evident for years - the codebase and the framework weren't exactly well-designed from the beginning. Lately XMMS1 hasn't been actively developed further, which can be attributed to the lack of active developers, but also to a broken codebase. Adding new features is bulky - some of the most wanted ones would be near impossible to add. Some parts of XMMS1 are beyond patching, so a re-write of the framework is needed.

As the years went by, GStreamer was born - a generic multimedia framework with lots of flexible modularity and extensible plugin-architecture. GStreamer is an interesting concept, but XMMS, despite the name, was never meant to be a generic multimedia player. XMMS has always essentially been an audio player - the video plugins were just ugly glue for technical experimentation. GStreamer's goal is to be a generic multimedia framework; implementing everything in a very generic way tends to waste resources and GStreamer developers haven't exactly been sparing them in other ways either. XMMS2 does not need the video-related crud that GStreamer has. Also, XMMS2 aims for platform independence, which is not GStreamer's goal in a strict sense.

== What is XMMS2? How is it different? ==

Being namely the descendant of XMMS and especially marked second generation, people will have all kinds of expectations what XMMS2 will and will not be. I'll first list the whats and whatnots shortly and explain the reasons more thoroughly afterwards.

* XMMS2 is a music player, it plays audio.
* XMMS2 is not a video player.
* XMMS2 does have a GUI, but it is not integrated. Instead we talk about clients, and there can be many clients connected to the daemon.
* There will be one "official" GUI client and one "official" commandline client.

So, XMMS2 is definitely an audio player. But it is ''not'' a multimedia player - it will not play videos. It has a modular framework and plugin architecture for audio processing, visualisation and output, but this framework has not been designed to support video. Also the daemon/client-type design of XMMS2 (and the daemon being independent of any graphics output) practically prevents video output being implemented. Reasons for this have been stated in the section above (''Why XMMS2?'')
