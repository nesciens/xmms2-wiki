This page is an attempt at bringing together information about various works in progress to produce a common media player control interface. Note that in the context of this page, ''interface'' refers to interface in the sense of an API, not an interface through which a user interacts with a program.

== Overview ==
In August 2005, Milosz Derezynski (deadchip) and Frederic Fondriest (ciberfred) were working on defining an interface for remotely controlling BMPx (as opposed to using the BMPx GUI) over DBUS:

 <ciberfred> hey deadchip , one things i'm currently thinking, we could do
 something with dbus to uniformize call functions, so each player could share
 same 'dbus-commands'
 <~deadchip> ah
 <~deadchip> yeah
 <~deadchip> that would be a very good idea
 <ciberfred> it could be better to let user choose the daemon they wants :)
 <ciberfred> like xmms2, bmpx, or lamip or well mpd or others
 <~deadchip> yeah
 <~deadchip> that is really good
 <ciberfred> so binaries commands audio could send informations from user
 to theses daemons without need to re-code somethings different but similare for
 another audio player

Thus [http://bmpx.beep-media-player.org/site/MPRIS_Interfacing_Specification MPRIS] (Media Player Remote Interface Specification) was born - a fairly generic interface with commands that could be applied to control a wide range of media players. However, even though the phrase 'Media Player' is present in MPRIS, the specification was developed with the assumption that it would be applied to audio players.

=== About MPRIS ===
* Defines commands for controlling a media player (play, pause, stop, etc).
* Defines signals that notify clients of certain events on the media player.
* Does NOT define audio or video data streaming protocols.
** That is, a client can't request audio or video stream data over MPRIS

=== Chalyx ===
Meanwhile, [[Sham Chukoury]] (eleusis) was working on an XMMS2 client named HaX (now known as [[Client:Chalyx|Chalyx]]). At some point, he decided it would be a great idea to be able to have a single client that could control multiple players, such as XMMS2, MPD and maybe even BMPx. So he made an [[Media Player Interfaces/Chalyx API Comparison|API comparison table]].

Most of the actions defined in the table were eventually defined in the [http://git.xmms.se/?p=chalyx-eleusis.git;a=blob;f=src/Chalyx/services/service.py Service] abstract class in Chalyx (and subsequently [http://git.xmms.se/?p=chalyx-eleusis.git;a=blob;f=src/Chalyx/services/xmms2.py XMMS2] and [http://git.xmms.se/?p=chalyx-eleusis.git;a=blob;f=src/Chalyx/services/mpd.py MPD] service modules were developed). As such, any client that uses the Chalyx library (such as [http://git.xmms.se/?p=kjell.git;a=summary Kjell] and [[Client:Insanity|Insanity]]) is able to control both XMMS2 and MPD. The design of Chalyx permits the development of additional 'service' modules to allow clients to control other music player backends.

=== VLC ===
Fast forward to November 2006 and RafaÃ«l CarrÃ© from the VLC project decided to implement a DBUS control interface for VLC. He discovered MPRIS and decided to adapt it to his needs. RafaÃ«l also decided to mail other media player projects to revive the spirit of MPRIS, and all hell broke loose across 10 different mailing lists.

== Current ==
;Discussion
:Discussion is proceeding on the [http://developers.videolan.org/lists.html vlc-devel] mailing list. (see specific thread linked [[#See_Also|below]]) Milosz has proposed to set up an mpris-devel mailing list hosted by BMPx.
;Issues
* Default player/interface name handling
* Rants about DBUS/XML
* UPnP?

== DBUS ==
;Advantages
* Widespread
;Disadvantages
* Doesn't work well over TCP? (e.g. compare with MPD's & XMMS2's support for tcp sockets)

== Projects involved ==
=== [http://xmms2.xmms.se XMMS2] ===
For XMMS2, a proxy could be developed to translate between DBUS and XMMS2's own [[Design of XMMS2#Middleware | IPC mechanism]]. ([[User:Anders Gustafsson|Anders]] may have already done some work on this)
