This page is an attempt at bringing together information about various works in progress to produce a common media player control interface. Note that in the context of this page, ''interface'' refers to interface in the sense of an API, not an interface through which a user interacts with a program.

= Background =
== Overview ==
In August 2005, Milosz Derezynski (deadchip) and Frederic Fondriest (ciberfred) were working on defining an interface for remotely controlling BMPx (as opposed to using the BMPx GUI) over DBUS:

 <ciberfred> hey deadchip , one things i'm currently thinking, we could do
 something with dbus to uniformize call functions, so each player could share
 same 'dbus-commands'
 <~deadchip> ah
 <~deadchip> yeah
 <~deadchip> that would be a very good idea
 <ciberfred> it could be better to let user choose the daemon they wants :)
 <ciberfred> like xmms2, bmpx, or lamip or well mpd or others
 <~deadchip> yeah
 <~deadchip> that is really good
 <ciberfred> so binaries commands audio could send informations from user
 to theses daemons without need to re-code somethings different but similare for
 another audio player

Thus [http://bmpx.beep-media-player.org/site/MPRIS_Interfacing_Specification MPRIS] (Media Player Remote Interface Specification) was born - a fairly generic interface with commands that could be applied to control a wide range of media players. However, even though the phrase 'Media Player' is present in MPRIS, the specification was developed with the assumption that it would be applied to audio players.

=== About MPRIS ===
* Defines commands for controlling a media player (play, pause, stop, etc).
* Defines signals that notify clients of certain events on the media player.
* Does NOT define audio or video data streaming protocols.
** That is, a client can't request audio or video stream data over MPRIS

=== Chalyx ===
Meanwhile, [[Sham Chukoury]] (eleusis) was working on an XMMS2 client named HaX (now known as [[Client:Chalyx|Chalyx]]). At some point, he decided it would be a great idea to be able to have a single client that could control multiple players, such as XMMS2, MPD and maybe even BMPx. So he made an [[Media Player Interfaces/Chalyx API Comparison|API comparison table]].

Most of the actions defined in the table were eventually defined in the [http://git.xmms.se/?p=chalyx-eleusis.git;a=blob;f=src/Chalyx/services/service.py Service] abstract class in Chalyx (and subsequently [http://git.xmms.se/?p=chalyx-eleusis.git;a=blob;f=src/Chalyx/services/xmms2.py XMMS2] and [http://git.xmms.se/?p=chalyx-eleusis.git;a=blob;f=src/Chalyx/services/mpd.py MPD] service modules were developed). As such, any client that uses the Chalyx library (such as [http://git.xmms.se/?p=kjell.git;a=summary Kjell] and [[Client:Insanity|Insanity]]) is able to control both XMMS2 and MPD. The design of Chalyx permits the development of additional 'service' modules to allow clients to control other music player backends.

=== VLC ===
Fast forward to November 2006 and RafaÃ«l CarrÃ© from the VLC project decided to implement a DBUS control interface for VLC. He discovered MPRIS and decided to adapt it to his needs. RafaÃ«l also decided to mail other media player projects to revive the spirit of MPRIS, and all hell broke loose across 10 different mailing lists.

== Current ==
;Discussion
:Discussion was proceeding on the [http://developers.videolan.org/lists.html vlc-devel] mailing list. (see specific thread linked [[#See_Also|below]]) Milosz has proposed to set up an mpris-devel mailing list hosted by BMPx.
:A dedicated mpris at videolan.org mailing list is set up, it should be an as ''LOW'' traffic list as possible and used only to coordinate the work and where developpers disagree on a part of the spec. Otherwise, please use this wiki page.

== DBUS ==
;Advantages
* Widespread
;Disadvantages
* Doesn't work well over TCP? (e.g. compare with MPD's & XMMS2's support for tcp sockets)

== Projects involved ==
=== [http://xmms2.xmms.se XMMS2] ===
For XMMS2, a proxy could be developed to translate between DBUS and XMMS2's own [[Design of XMMS2#Middleware | IPC mechanism]]. ([[User:Anders Gustafsson|Anders]] may have already done some work on this)

;MPRIS
:Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification

== Definitions ==

=== "Media Player" ===

An application, either with GUI or GUI-less (or which allows for both modes of operation) which is capable of playing back audio/video streams. The means by which it does accomplish that (e.g. which audio backend to use, and which output method) is out of the scope of this document.

The "Media Player" '''must''':
* Be able to play back at least local storage file streams.
* Be able to play back at least one stream at a time.

=== "Client" ===

The Client is an unspecified application that will interact with the "Media Player" using D-Bus protocol.
For example:

* A softphone, that pauses, or step the volume down, when a call is being received.
* An applet that nicely integrates in your desktop environment, to control your "Media Player".
* An instant messaging client which informs your buddies of what you're listening to.
* A monitor that stores in a database what you are listening to, for statistics purpose.
* A video editing software that calls an external "Media Player" to preview your work.

=== "Tracklist" ===

A list of media files which resides within the "Media Player", and whose implementation is opaque to the remote interface.

The "Tracklist" '''must''':
* Hold an ordered list of locations of the media files as URIs (e.g. file:// or <nowiki>http://</nowiki>). The implementation of this can be opaque, which means, it does not neccesarily need to store URIs, but upon remote request, it must be able to return an URI for a given media file.
* Keep the list in an ordered fashion. The order can be changed at any time trough e.g. sorting algorithms, in which case the "Media Player" must send information about the reordering trough it's remote interface

The "Tracklist" '''can''', but does not '''need''' to:
* Hold "Metadata" about media files

=== "Metadata" ===

"Metadata" is data that the files carry within themselves as a means of self-identification (commonly known as "tags"), or data that has been retrieved about the files trough other means, e.g. an internet service that provides additional data about particular media files.
"Metadata" is an array of dict entries, like ("length", 253), ("name", "Bolero"), ("video-codec", "DIVX"). The dict entry is in the form (string, variant) eg: {sv}.

Furthermore, "Metadata" can be split into two categories:

1) Technical metadata:
* "URI":"s"
* "length":"i" (length in seconds)
* "video-codec":"s" (video codec as a fourcc)
* "audio-codec":"s" (audio codec as a fourcc)
* "video-bitrate":"i" video bitrate
* "audio-bitrate":"i" audio bitrate
* "audio-samplerate":"i" (audio samplerate)

2) Informational metadata
* "name":"s"
* "artist":"s"
* "album":"s"
* "unique-id":"s" : Musicbrainz Track Identifier as specified on http://musicbrainz.org/docs/specs/metadata_tags.html
* "genre":"s"

This list is informative, and can be extended up to your needs, for example: "age of the captain":"i"

Only Required fields are: "URI" and "length"

Notes:
* MPRIS implementations MUST provide at least the ''Basic'' interface.
* Seeking and the reporting of current stream position will be done in milliseconds - players which can't handle millisecond-level resolution should round up or down to the nearest position they can handle.

== D-Bus ==

=== The Service ===

org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer

All "Media Players" '''must''' request this name and do not let other "Media Players" 'steal' this name.
Using libdbus, that would be:

 DBusConnection *dbus_connection;
 DBusError dbus_error;
 dbus_bus_request_name( dbus_connection, "org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer", 0, &dbus_error );

To be able to request the name, and so, be able to communicate via D-Bus, no "Media Player" must be running. The "Media Player" may call the Quit method, and wait till the name is unregistered, to ensure this is the case.

: I think this is a bad idea, it's not the place for a interop Spec to force single instance behaviour without a good reason (i run amarok all the time and use vlc to play videos or streams...). Why not suggest that mediaplayers register with the well known service name ("org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer") with the options QueueService and suggest the media player should register an application specific service in addition?

: if done that way we gain the feature to query the dbus daemon for all clients queued for that dbus name, so enumerating all current musicplayers that support the Spec is not problem. Contacting the players is not problem to because every client on dbus has a unique name anyway. DBus signal do AFAIK carry the dbus service name of the sending client, so there is no trouble knowing which player send a signal. [[User:textshell|textshell]]

=== The interface ===

All methods must be accessed through the interface org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer

i.e. calling Quit with qdbus would be:
 $ qdbus org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer /Player org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer.Quit

== The ''basic'' interface ==
* Playback
** Play/Start
** Stop
** Pause
** Seek (milliseconds)
** Get Current Status (playing/paused/stopped)
** Get Current Playback Position (position in currently playing stream - milliseconds)
** SIGNAL: Playback position (playtime - milliseconds)
* Playlist
** Previous
** Next
** Add/Enqueue (URL)
** Remove
** Clear
** Get list
** Get Current Playlist Position (zero-indexed)
** SIGNAL: Playlist Position
* Info
** Identity/Version
** Get Current Song (returns unique identifier, which can be used to get associated metadata)
** Get Song Metadata
** SIGNAL: Current Song (unique identifier, same as ''Get Current Song'')
* Session
** Quit (player shutdown)
* Output
** Get Volume
** Set Volume
