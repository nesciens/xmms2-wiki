When you have done a change to the git tree and want to commit it. The ChangeLog should be formated like this:

<TAG>:Text

Where TAG should be one of the following:

* FEATURE: general feature add in the daemon.
* BUG: fix for a bug filed in mantis, should also refer to that bug ''BUG: #177 - Fixed chrashbug in medialib''
* CLIENTLIB: important if you change anything in the clientlib. this will be tracked by bindings and client developers.
* PRIVATE: a change that won't be propagated i a ChangeLog. mostly unimportant things like spelling misstakes.
* DOC: documentation / comment updates.


''' THIS IS A PROPOSAL '''
