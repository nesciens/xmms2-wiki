''' THIS IS A PROPOSAL '''

When you have done a change to the git tree and want to commit it. The commit message should have tags as follows:

<TAG>:Text

Where TAG should be one of the following:

* BUG: Fix for a bug filed in mantis, should also refer to that bug ''BUG(177) - Fixed chrashbug in medialib''
* FEATURE: general feature added in the daemon. Since feature requests are also filed on the bug tracker, this tag should also be followed by a bug number.
* CLIENTLIB: important if you change anything in the clientlib. this will be tracked by bindings and client developers.
* OTHER: a change that won't be propagated i a ChangeLog. mostly unimportant things like spelling mistakes.
* DOC: documentation / comment updates.

Perhaps the following tags might also be useful:
* CLI: command line client
* ALSA, OSS, VORBIS (plugin name): changes to various plugins (''src/plugins'')
* PYTHON: changes to Python bindings
* RUBY: changes to Ruby bindings
* C# binding? (this category is represented on Mantis, I don't know if it's still valid)
* MLIB: changes to medialib (including sqlite?)
* SCONS: changes to scons conf/build system
* IPC: changes to IPC layer
* TRANSPORT, DECODER, OUTPUT: changes to these modules...
* CONFIG: changes to daemon config system
* PLAYLIST: changes to playlist module

Perhaps not so useful, but I'll list them anyway...
* VIS: visualisation data
* PLUGIN: changes to plugin API?
* HEADER: changes to include files?

Once a firmer consensus on this proposal is achieved, some of these tags will be used to categorise bugs on the Mantis bug tracker.
