=== What is xmms2-freedb? ===
When xmms2-freedb is run, it waits till an entry to medialib is added, and when it's a cdda:// entry, it looks up the CD information in a remote CD-Audio database and update the fields.
Currently the application is set to use freedb.freedb.org via CDDB protocol as there's no config yet.

=== Requirements ===
* glibc
* libdiscid
* xmms2-client-cpp
