{{Client |name=Chalyx| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| website=http://eleusis.f2o.org/projects/xmms2/chalyx/| version= Unknown| devlanguage=Python| ui=Multiple| screenshots=N/A| description=Chalyx (previously known as HaX) is a flexible and modular Python client for XMMS2. What started off as a PyGTK project has evolved into a reusable collection of modules that may be used to quickly build other Python XMMS2 clients, integrate a player client into a larger Python application, or simply provide smarter 'skinning' abilities. Chalyx is also expected to become a client for MPD and BMPx.}}
