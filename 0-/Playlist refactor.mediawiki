The new playlist will be able to have different backends. And all playlist is handled the same way. It should follow the current API quite closely with some modifications.

# All playlist calls should have a "identifier" argument ( playlist_new (identifier), playlist_clear (identifier), playlist_add (identifier) )
# Signals should be emitted with the identifer argument
# a new call that switchs current playlist to identifer should be implemented (playlist_switch (identifer))

The primary storage backend for playlists should probably be a sqlite db. (not using the current medialib.db, but playlists.db because of locking issues).


Rough todo list:
* Make playlist module able to switch backend
* add identifer to each call
* make a sqlite backend
* remove current playlists implementation in medialib.c
* add other backends?
