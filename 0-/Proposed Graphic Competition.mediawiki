== Why? ==

We need a graphic profile and logo for XMMS2. We have gone far enough without one. I suggest we put the money from SoC in good use and get ourself something that we can use.

The plan is two competitions, one for Logo, when it's done we start the second competition, for wiki design.

== Logo Rules ==

* Format '''must''' be SVG.
* Submitted image must be usable on black and white background.
* Clean, "[[Wikipedia:Scandinavian Design|scandinavian]]" style.
* The '''2''' should be integrated without looking sticked on.
* Deadline 1 Nov 2006

== WIKI Design Rules ==

* Format '''must''' be a working HTML page with CSS.
* Should incorporate the logotype in a '''seamless''' way.
* '''May''' change colors in logo but not form.
* Clean, "[[Wikipedia:Scandinavian Design|scandinavian]]" style.
* Fixed background skins will be disqualified
* Coding style is valued, keep CSS / HTML to standards that works in all browsers and are easy to change and continues to work when wiki is upgrade to a newer version of mediawiki.
* Deadline 15th Dec 2006

== Unresolved issues ==
* Submission routine?
** We should work out exactly ''what'' the deliverables should be, then we can figure out ''how'' they're to be submitted. [[User:Eleusis|Eleusis]] 14:45, 11 September 2006 (CEST)
* What if a user wants to do 1 and 2? and wins, does he get like two DAP's then?
** YES! --[[User:Knirch|Knirch]] 19:03, 5 September 2006 (CEST)
*** Maybe it should be switchable for something else was the point. --[[User:TobiasRundstrÃ¶m|tru]] 05:42, 6 September 2006 (CEST)
* Tax regulations?
* Material should be licensed GFDL and copyrighted to XMMS2 TEAM?
** We should definitely be granted rights to do whatever we want with the winning design(s).. Furthermore, competitors should probably understand that they can't retain the right to use the winning logo for some other purpose, as it will become something like a ''trademark'' for XMMS2. [[User:Eleusis|Eleusis]] 14:45, 11 September 2006 (CEST)
* Jury - Everyone in AUTHORS get a vote? veto by core team?
** Must be able to veto! heck, give away something AND have to settle for something a drunken freenoder spew out while being molested by lilo does not compute! --[[User:Knirch|Knirch]] 19:03, 5 September 2006 (CEST)
*** Agreed, should the veto be me, anders, tilman, eleusis or something like that? --[[User:TobiasRundstrÃ¶m|tru]] 05:42, 6 September 2006 (CEST)
** For this to work, ''core team'' needs a clear definition before the start of the event. [[User:Eleusis|Eleusis]] 14:45, 11 September 2006 (CEST)
* shouldn't wiki design be in the format of a mediawiki skin? [[User:Anders Gustafsson|Anders Gustafsson]] 16:51, 6 September 2006 (CEST)
** Yes --[[User:TobiasRundstrÃ¶m|tru]] 17:47, 6 September 2006 (CEST)
