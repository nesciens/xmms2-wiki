{{Client| name=xmms2-shell| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| website=http://eleusis.f2o.org/projects/xmms2/shell/| version=N/A| devlanguage=Python| ui=Console| screenshots=N/A| description=xmms2-shell is an interactive shell client for XMMS2. It's like [http://freshmeat.net/projects/xmms-shell/ xmms-shell], but with commands matching the XMMS2 CLI client. It was originally written  so as to provide a better context in which to interact with the XMMS2 daemon, rather than having to run the CLI client for a single action at a time. xmms2-shell is currently pending a rewrite - use [[Client:nyello | nyello]] instead.}}
