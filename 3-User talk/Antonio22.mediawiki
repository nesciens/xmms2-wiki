I am from Colombia studying engineering the ESCUELA COLOMBIANA DE INGENIERIA,8 semester,23 years old, i have work over 4 semesters with C++ language, SQL, making lots and small academic projects, with ubuntu some things, i also recognize media player some of them...and widgets using them on ubuntu and windows vista...

My question is if its there any posibility that i can apply on that project, and if its there any chance to learn everything on this period to make that project succeed, knowing my conditions and on my field of studying...
