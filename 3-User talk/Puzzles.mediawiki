XMMS2 \o/
I strive to improve the greatest music player of all time every chance I get. I've been busy, angry, and tired, but I always come back and I've contributed a lot more than I and most people expected of me. I hope to keep my name in the AUTHORS file long after XMMS2 becomes the new standard music player on everyone's desktop.
