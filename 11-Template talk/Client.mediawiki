While the recently by [[User:Malvineous|Malvineous]] applied Wikipedia infobox style looks nice, it has some issues:
# Homepage URLs are not properly wrapped over multiple lines (see revision 8676 of [[Client:Remuco]]).
# There is an image included, but this Wiki is not able to upload image (webserver is not allowed to write files).
# The automatic categories look awkward if a client uses multiple languages (see [[Client:Remuco]]).
