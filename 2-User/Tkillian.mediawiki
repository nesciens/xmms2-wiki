* '''Have you contacted an XMMS2 mentor and discussed the project already? Note that we won't read the application until you answer YES on this question.'''
** ''Yes - Talked with Tobias RundstrÃ¶m''
* '''Basics'''
** Just write a small introduction to yourself.
*** ''Hi, my name is Taylor Killian, and I love open source. I have been programming since I was 10, after I got my first computer. I got into program so I could be a hacker, not knowing that I was building myself a bright future as a programmer. From there I went off an learned a bunch of languages. I kept on taking on on challenge after another until I was was at the level of those I once looked up to, but realized I have a long way to go. But I'm not all computer all the time, I also like to wrestle and play Guitar Hero. And I guess thats a pretty good size 'small' intro.''
** State your preferred email address.
*** ''s7master@gmail.com''
** Why do you want to participate in summer of code?
*** ''I want to participate in the summer of code because I know it is going to be a challenge. I know I am going to have to work hard and long, but at the end I will be able to say that I was a part of something truly great. I know that I will be a better programmer for it too.''
** What are you studying, subject, level and school?
*** ''I am studying Computer Science and Engineering as a freshmen at [http://www.cscc.edu Columbus State Community College]''

*** ''Yes, but''
** Have you participated to the Google Summer of Code before? As a mentor or a student? In what project? Were you successful? If not, why?
** What development model would you use (e.g. keywords: V-model, XP programming, agile programming, iterative; with the help of prototyping, formal specifications, tests, etc).
** '''Open Source'''
*** Are you already involved with any open source development? If yes, please describe the project and the scope of your involvement.

** What would make you stay in the xmms2-community after the conclusion of SOC?
* '''Practically'''

*** What is your perception of 'Open Source'? Briefly explain what you think of the whole 'Open Source' concept, how you discovered Open Source, what you expect to gain/experience by participating in an Open Source project. (Either separate answer, or as part of above mini-essay)
*** What motivates or inspires you to write programs/develop software?
