Hi. I'm a coder since 1980 and a linux user since 1994.
I live in central Finland with my children and my wife.
I was born in 1972.

I like very much the languages like ruby and perl, but 
looks like I need to code the XMMuSed2 either in C or Python. 

I work as a perl monkey for [http://www.skillnet.fi/english/ Skillnet Oy] (Finland) and my
personal homepages (in Finnish) are at http://vuoret.net/markus/
