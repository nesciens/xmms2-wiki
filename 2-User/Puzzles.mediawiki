My real name is Dan Chokola. I'm not much of a coder, though I've coded a handful of things for xmms2. I hang around in #xmms2 a lot, and I try to contribute clients, features, possible solutions, general moral support, and I find lots of bugs (which often turn out to be my own stupid fault).
You can find my website at [http://dan.chokola.com dan.chokola.com] (big surprise!) with all sorts of cool stuff on it. Well, it's only cool if you're a geek.
