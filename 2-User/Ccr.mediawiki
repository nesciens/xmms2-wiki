I'm working on a rant/document [[about XMMS2]], especially the following topics:
* Why XMMS2?
* What XMMS2 is and what it is not?
* How is XMMS2 different from other projects?

My intention is to address various questions about feasibility and goals of the XMMS2 project and contrast the design in comparision to other similar projects (including GStreamer, mdp, BeepMP, etc.)
