= Server =

= Scanning =

* I have ~100,000 songs (legally :-) ). Scan the lib at max. disk speed.
* Optimize sqlite DB and usage. Don't store most common attributes like title, artist, album not as generic properties as one row each in a separate table, but as columns in the song (item) table. Compare filesystem with EA. Should dramatically improve speed. Keep this speed optimization in the sqlite store, not necessarily exposed in the API (but that may provide speed advantages, too, in the network protocol and API calls).

= Other =

* <s>pulse volume!</s> (solved after 0.4, yay!)

= Client =

== Collections ==

* define queries by user
* define queries based on directory on disk
* combine queries
* search for this artist (available on any song)
* search for collections containing this song/artist (on any song)

== Collection/Playlist UI ==
** when adding song to playlist, optionally start to play immediately
** faster add/remove to playlist - drag&drop (e.g. drag from lib to add, drag outside window to remove)

== Edit/sanitize metadata  ==

** merge artist spelling (ignore caps, spaces?) in client
** fix spelling (rename artist of all songs of one artist), maybe by drag&drop over other, maybe as script/batch
** fix "feat." in artist
** alter metadata in store, write to ID3 in file

== Song metadata ==

** see more infos on song (pathname, rating, collections contained in)
** rating, incl. export / save & import of ratings in medialib to XML or TXT file

== UI structure ==

* windows: lib and playlist (and player) connected (incl. fast open/close) or independent, optional
