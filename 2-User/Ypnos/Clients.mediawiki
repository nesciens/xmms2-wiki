There are a number of client programs currently being developed for use with XMMS2. Some of them are very simple and perform only a handful of functions, while others are more fully featured.

If you are a new XMMS2 client developer, you're welcome to add your client to the [[Clientlist | list] and drop by our [irc://chat.freenode.net/xmms2 IRC channel] to let us know what you're doing, so we may work closely together.

'''Note:''' While most other players give you an 'all-in-one' experience, when it comes to XMMS2 it can be worthwile to have several different clients running at once. Features like desktop integration, on-screen displays, etc. are mostly done in several clients written esp. for this task. Just have a look around!
