Stu Black (nollidj), located in the USA.  Mostly self-taught background in programming and trying to get back into university for an actual master's degree in computer science.  Talk to me in Russian or Spanish if you want.

I am interested in building good metadata support into xmms2 so that I will finally have a sufficiently flexible, powerful music system at my fingertips.  As far as I'm concerned, everyone can benefit from improved use of metadata.

As such my primary interest is twofold:

* Develop medialib support for extensible, pluggable metadata profiles so that arbitrary fields exposed by xform plugins for a given music stream are mapped nicely to the medialib properties API.
* Develop a client or two that support using these nice profiles.

I'm now taking a hiatus from all involvement with OSS projects to get away from computers while I am healing from RSI.  I hope I'll be back.
