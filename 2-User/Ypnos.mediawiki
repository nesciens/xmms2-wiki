Although my name is ypnos here, I'm also known as FoPref (abbr. for Ford Prefect). Most times I'm around on IRC, that's my nickname.

I'm working on Visualization this summer. You can find more information about it '''[[Summer_of_Code_2007/Visualization|here]]'''!

See [http://fopref.meinungsverstaerker.de/xmms-rootvis XMMS Rootvis] for my XMMS Visualization plugin :)
