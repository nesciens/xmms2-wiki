Tilmus Sauvalds is a legend.

== Life ==
* He is reported to have coded the linux kernel in machine code in under an hour.
* He once killed a man using only an e-mail after this man added an unnecessary #ifdef to the XMMS2 source.

== Diet ==
His diet consists mainly of babies (dead or alive), with the occasional barrel of whiskey to wash it down. He can unhinge his jaw and swallow his prey alive and dissolve them with his mighty stomach acids.
