OK, that's enough sarcasm, here it is in plain english: XMMS2 does not, and cannot, bundle any spyware components and here's why:
# We make it abundantly clear exactly what [[ET | xmms2-et]] is, why it exists and what it does.
# xmms2-et does get installed by default, but it makes no attempt to hide the fact.
# The is no obscure EULA aimed at misleading you and tricking you into getting xmms2-et installed.
# The XMMS2 system and associated utilities are all available under open source licences. If you don't feel safe, you can look at the [http://git.xmms.se code] yourself and make up your own mind.

In short, we might be dropping aliens on your computer, but they're friendly and harmless, and you can ask them to leave at any time!
