{{Newsitem| date=7 July 2006 WST (2006-07-07)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=You're the best evil son an evil dad could ever ask for| text=Winter in Chile, tropical heat in Europe; wherever you are this new release comes as a cool breeze. The XMMS2 Team is happy to announce the release of [[Release:DrEvil | DrEvil]]. This monster of a release will bring the much expected [[Transforms]] concept and might crash your computer a few times due to the extensive changes. Please be aware that this should be considered as less stable than [[Release:DrDoolittle|DrDolittle]], so please use this release to help us find bugs in Transforms and port your plugins to the new API. Also this release fixes a lot of the problems that were around with the older architecture, like gapless playback, FLACs getting played by the MAD plugin and so on.

We are now aiming for the next release which will include some of the [[Summer of Code 2006 | Summer of Code]] students' contributions.}}
