{{Newsitem| date=8 September 2006 WST (2006-09-08)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=End of SoC 2006| text=Google's [[Summer of Code 2006]] ended a couple of weeks ago, and we're still wrapping up some of the successful XMMS2 projects. All in all, we achieved a success rate of about 80%. You can now look forward to [[SoC:DAAP|DAAP]] support in XMMS2, and a polished up [[Client:TurboX2|TurboX2]] client for the [[Release:DrGonzo|next release]]. Hot on the heels of these projects is the [[Collections]] project by [[SÃ©bastien Cevey]] which is still in its final stages of integration, and is planned for release with [[Release:DrHouse|DrHouse]].

You'll also notice the new wiki layout, with a skin unofficially codenamed ''SeriousGrey'', an improved sidebar, courtesy of a new Mediawiki 1.7 feature, and a re-minted homepage inspired by [http://www.mono-project.com mono-project.com] and [http://hula-project.org hula-project.org]. Various pages have also been revised and polished up. Some new highlights are [[screenshots]] and a few reminders about [[what XMMS2 will not do]]. As usual, this is a wiki, so please help us keep it interesting!}}

{{Newsitem| date=7 July 2006 WST (2006-07-07)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=You're the best evil son an evil dad could ever ask for| text=Winter in Chile, tropical heat in Europe; wherever you are this new release comes as a cool breeze. The XMMS2 Team is happy to announce the release of [[Release:DrEvil | DrEvil]]. This monster of a release will bring the much expected [[Transforms]] concept and might crash your computer a few times due to the extensive changes. Please be aware that this should be considered as less stable than [[Release:DrDoolittle|DrDolittle]], so please use this release to help us find bugs in Transforms and port your plugins to the new API. Also this release fixes a lot of the problems that were around with the older architecture, like gapless playback, FLACs getting played by the MAD plugin and so on.

We are now aiming for the next release which will include some of the [[Summer of Code 2006 | Summer of Code]] students' contributions.}}
