{{Newsitem| date=8 September 2006 WST (2006-09-08)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=End of SoC 2006| text=Google's [[Summer of Code 2006]] ended a couple of weeks ago, and we're still wrapping up some of the successful XMMS2 projects. All in all, we achieved a success rate of about 80%. You can now look forward to [[SoC:DAAP|DAAP]] support in XMMS2, and a polished up [[Client:TurboX2|TurboX2]] client for the [[Release:DrGonzo|next release]]. Hot on the heels of these projects is the [[Collections]] project by [[SÃ©bastien Cevey]] which is still in its final stages of integration, and is planned for release with [[Release:DrHouse|DrHouse]].

You'll also notice the new wiki layout, with a skin unofficially codenamed ''SeriousGrey'', an improved sidebar, courtesy of a new Mediawiki 1.7 feature, and a re-minted homepage inspired by [http://www.mono-project.com mono-project.com] and [http://hula-project.org hula-project.org]. Various pages have also been revised and polished up. Some new highlights are [[screenshots]] and a few reminders about [[what XMMS2 will not do]]. As usual, this is a wiki, so please help us keep it interesting!}}
