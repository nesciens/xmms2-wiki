;Client-server model :

* Allows XMMS2 to have various multiple interfaces (as clients).
** Command line interfaces
** GTK clients (matching GNOME & XFCE4 look and feel)
** KDE clients (matching KDE look and feel)
* Network transparency means you can run and control XMMS2 remotely, (e.g. run XMMS2 on your 'media box' and control it over network using a bluetooth-enabled PDA (TCP) - see [[Mobile platforms]])

;Wide format support :
Can play FLAC, mp3, MOD, SID, speex, ogg vorbis, wave files.
;Clean separation of [[Component:Transport | transport]] and [[Component:Decoder | decoder]] subsystems :
Allows for more flexible access to media. (e.g. play mp3 files from a Samba share without having to mount it on the local filesystem)
;[[The Medialib | Medialib]] :
Database-driven media library stores metadata about songs as they're played, so songs can be quickly recalled and new playlists easily made. The medialib import process is *very* fast. It imports 1200 songs in 6 minutes on a P3 1.5GHz system.
;Visualisation support
;Slow speed support :
Allows for sluggish GUI responses to emulate a cool, "retro" music player feel
;Bug support :
Contains extra bugs (for example, it will just crash if you play an unsupported format instead of returning an error message) for more linux fun
;General shittiness
We plan to add a user interface forty times worse than that of iTunes, and fuck everything up in general
