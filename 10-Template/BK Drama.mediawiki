'''''BitKeeper Drama'''''

Since [http://www.bitkeeper.com BitMover] has decided to [http://www.bitkeeper.com/press/2005-04-05.html cease supporting] the free (as in beer) version of BitKeeper, we are currently evaluating alternative SCMs to switch to. We are looking for BK-style distributed repository systems, so centralised systems such as Subversion and CVS are out of the question. The devel team still uses BK since we have not chosen a new SCM yet. The BK is not available for others then devel team at this point. Please try our snapshots page instead.
