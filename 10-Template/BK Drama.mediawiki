'''''(End of) BitKeeper Drama'''''

Since [http://www.bitkeeper.com BitMover] decided to [http://www.bitkeeper.com/press/2005-04-05.html cease supporting] the free (as in beer) version of BitKeeper, we decided to switch to an alternative SCM that would match our workflow with BK as closely as possible. Since releasing [[Release:DR1 | DR1]], the XMMS2 team has switched to using Git/Cogito. The repository is accessible via the web at http://git.xmms2.org
