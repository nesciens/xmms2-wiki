{{Newsitem| date=11 January 2007 WDST (2007-01-11)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=We interrupt your regular program for a short announcement| text=You might have met our most [[IRC Quotes/2006#2006-11-19_-_XMMS2_is_spyware | ''serious'' user]], but I bet you didn't know that the incident has made [[wikipedia:XMMS2#Spyware_'Controversy' | Wikipedia]]! OK, that's enough sarcasm, here it is in plain english: XMMS2 does not, and cannot, bundle any spyware components and here's why:
# We make it abundantly clear exactly what [[ET | xmms2-et]] is, why it exists and what it does.
# xmms2-et does get installed by default, but it makes no attempt to hide the fact.
# The is no obscure EULA aimed at misleading you and tricking you into getting xmms2-et installed.
# The XMMS2 system and associated utilities are all available under open source licences. If you don't feel safe, you can look at the [http://git.xmms2.org code] yourself and make up your own mind.

In short, we might be dropping aliens on your computer, but they're friendly and harmless, and you can ask them to leave at any time!

We are releasing a new Developer Release to the wild. This one is dubbed [[Release:DrGonzo|DrGonzo]] and includes a heap of new exciting bugs (a.k.a. features). This is the first release of XMMS2 that contains code sponsored by Google Summer of Code.

{{Newsitem| date=8 September 2006 WST (2006-09-08)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=End of SoC 2006| text=Google's [[Summer of Code 2006]] ended a couple of weeks ago, and we're still wrapping up some of the successful XMMS2 projects. All in all, we achieved a success rate of about 80%. You can now look forward to [[SoC:DAAP|DAAP]] support in XMMS2, and a polished up [[Client:TurboX2|TurboX2]] client for the [[Release:DrGonzo|next release]]. Hot on the heels of these projects is the [[Collections]] project by [[SÃ©bastien Cevey]] which is still in its final stages of integration, and is planned for release with [[Release:DrHouse|DrHouse]].

You'll also notice the new wiki layout, with a skin unofficially codenamed ''SeriousGrey'', an improved sidebar, courtesy of a new Mediawiki 1.7 feature, and a re-minted homepage inspired by [http://www.mono-project.com mono-project.com] and [http://hula-project.org hula-project.org]. Various pages have also been revised and polished up. Some new highlights are [[screenshots]] and a few reminders about [[what XMMS2 will not do]]. As usual, this is a wiki, so please help us keep it interesting!}}

{{Newsitem| date=15 July 2006 CLST (2006-07-15)| author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]| title=This must feel soooo good!| text=[[Release:DrFeelgood|DrFeelgood]] is a fast bugfix release to DrEvil. Nothing fancy, but upgrade if you want to get rid of annoying bugs.

{{Newsitem| date=7 July 2006 WST (2006-07-07)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=You're the best evil son an evil dad could ever ask for| text=Winter in Chile, tropical heat in Europe; wherever you are this new release comes as a cool breeze. The XMMS2 Team is happy to announce the release of [[Release:DrEvil | DrEvil]]. This monster of a release will bring the much expected [[Transforms]] concept and might crash your computer a few times due to the extensive changes. Please be aware that this should be considered as less stable than [[Release:DrDoolittle|DrDolittle]], so please use this release to help us find bugs in Transforms and port your plugins to the new API. Also this release fixes a lot of the problems that were around with the older architecture, like gapless playback, FLACs getting played by the MAD plugin and so on.

We are now aiming for the next release which will include some of the [[Summer of Code 2006 | Summer of Code]] students' contributions.}}
{{Newsitem| date=25 May 2006 WST (2006-05-25)| author=[[Sham Chukoury]]| title=Summer of Code really begins| text=Hello World. The application and evaluation periods of SoC2006 are finally over and selected applicants can now start working on their awesome proposals. Here at XMMS2, we received about 50 proposals, which was quite surprising.. we were expecting something of the order of a dozen or so.. ;) In the end, it did come down to almost a dozen good-quality proposals fighting for our attention, but we could only accept five of them. So, for 2006, the XMMS2 SoC projects are (in no particular order):

* Support for DAAP
** '''Student''': Cole Thompson
** '''Mentor''': Tobias RundstrÃ¶m

* TurboX2 Release Engineering and Development
** '''Student''': Alexander Botero-Lowry
** '''Mentor''': Tobias RundstrÃ¶m

* [[Collections]]
** '''Student''': SÃ©bastien Cevey
** '''Mentor''': Anders Gustafsson

* Support Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) and remote streaming to Airport Express in XMMS2
** '''Student''': Mohsin Patel
** '''Mentor''': Anders Gustafsson

* XMMS2 Test Framework
** '''Student''': Abdul Haseeb
** '''Mentor''': Sham Chukoury

The XMMS2 Team would like to thank all the students who applied and invite those who did not get accepted into SoC2006 to still make a contribution to XMMS2, if they're up to it.}}
