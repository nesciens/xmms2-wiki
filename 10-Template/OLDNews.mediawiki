{{Newsitem|date=19 August 2005 (2005-08-19) CET|author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]|title=Developer Release 2.1|text=Good news everyone! The XMMS2 Team is releasing a bugfix release of the current Developer Release ([[Release:DR2|DR2]]) called [[Release:DR2.1|DR2.1]]. This corrects some annoyances found by the community, the most prominent of those being an ID3v2.3 parsing error.

This release is compatible with DR2 and will not break the plugin API, medialib or client communication (we think).

Source is available at [[Download XMMS2#Source | sourceforge]] as usual.

Now have a nice day!}}

{{Newsitem|date=4 August 2005 (2005-08-04) CET|author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]|title=Developer Release 2|text=Hello intrawebb. The XMMS2 Team is happy to announce the release of XMMS2 [[Release:DR2|Developer Release 2]]. Delayed for a couple of weeks due to summer, beer, (plastic) women and other real life nonsense, we release a feature-packed second version of XMMS2. This release is the direct result of feedback from DR1 on both APIs, functionality and behaviour. We would like to thank everyone who provided us with feedback, patches and encouragement.

To review the ChangeLog please check the [[Release:DR2|Release Page]] and to download source code please surf to the [[Download XMMS2|Download]] page.}}

{{Newsitem|date=20 may 2005 (2005-05-20) CET|author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]|title=Developer Release 1|text=After over two years of development, the XMMS Team releases the first
preview of the next generation XMMS. XMMS2 is a complete rewrite of
the XMMS codebase and has been focusing on portability, code
separation and stability. An advanced feature of XMMS2 is that the
music player process runs separately from the user interface in a
client/server model. This simplifies the process of creating alternate
user interfaces and allow interface developers to concentrate on
designing the interface for their special need and not having to care
about the music playing part.

XMMS2 has now reached Developer Release 1! The target audience for
this release is developers, the player is NOT yet ready for public
consumption or for replacing XMMS1, RythmBox, AmaroK or MPD. This
simply means that the codebase is very nice and developers are
encouraged to help creating plugins and clients that will make XMMS2
the de facto standard for music playing, like XMMS1 has been for
almost a decade. At this point there are no mature and stable GUI
clients, but this preview is released in the hope that the development
of interfaces will accelerate.

We are also happy to include a music clip donated by industrial act Dismantled (http://www.dismantled.org/) in the distrbution.
