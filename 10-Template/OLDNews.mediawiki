{{Newsitem|date=20 may 2005 (2005-05-20) CET|author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]|title=Developer Release 1|text=After over two years of development, the XMMS Team releases the first
preview of the next generation XMMS. XMMS2 is a complete rewrite of
the XMMS codebase and has been focusing on portability, code
separation and stability. An advanced feature of XMMS2 is that the
music player process runs separately from the user interface in a
client/server model. This simplifies the process of creating alternate
user interfaces and allow interface developers to concentrate on
designing the interface for their special need and not having to care
about the music playing part.

XMMS2 has now reached Developer Release 1! The target audience for
this release is developers, the player is NOT yet ready for public
consumption or for replacing XMMS1, RythmBox, AmaroK or MPD. This
simply means that the codebase is very nice and developers are
encouraged to help creating plugins and clients that will make XMMS2
the de facto standard for music playing, like XMMS1 has been for
almost a decade. At this point there are no mature and stable GUI
clients, but this preview is released in the hope that the development
of interfaces will accelerate.

We are also happy to include a music clip donated by industrial act Dismantled (http://www.dismantled.org/) in the distrbution.

{{Newsitem|date=8 March 2005 (2005-03-08) CET|author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]|title=Big changes|text=Good news, after a month of almost no code committed to the XMMS2 trees there are now a lot of big updates in the main tree. Anders finally merged his sample_t changes and I got around to change the xmms_ipc_msg_t struct. Next big thing is the playlist update that should be comming soon. There will soon be a wrap-up meeting about the first DR release. Stay tuned.}}
