XMMS2 is a complete rewrite of the XMMS codebase and has been focusing on portability, code separation and stability. An advanced feature of XMMS2 is that the music player process runs separately from the GUI, which means that you can communicate with the player via IPC commands. This will allow developers to create advanced GUIs and not have to care about the music playing part.

We have reached Developer Release 1; this means that the player is NOT ready for public consumption or for replacing XMMS1, RythmBox, AmaroK or MPD. This simply means that we have a very nice working codebase and we are happy to invite developers to help us with this. At this point there is no mature and stable clients, we hope that clients will mature after this release. Please download and contribute. Feedback and testing is also very helpful at this stage.

We are also happy to include a music clip donated by industrial act Dismantled (http://www.dismantled.org/) in the distrbution.

This will be exciting, all the team is confident that the current codebase is really neat. Keep an eye out as the [[Release:DR1 | Developer Release 1]] todo list items get taken care of. :)}}
{{Newsitem|date=8 March 2005 (2005-03-08) CET|author=[[Tobias RundstrÃ¶m]]|title=Big changes|text=Good news, after a month of almost no code committed to the XMMS2 trees there are now a lot of big updates in the main tree. Anders finally merged his sample_t changes and I got around to change the xmms_ipc_msg_t struct. Next big thing is the playlist update that should be comming soon. There will soon be a wrap-up meeting about the first DR release. Stay tuned.}}

{{Newsitem|date=10 February 2005 (2005-02-10) WST|author=[[Sham Chukoury]]|title=Wiki got a facelift|text=I've finished giving the wiki a bit of an overhaul, with gratuitous use of templates to implement all kinds of funky things like:
* This news section
* a new navigation bar
* a components status table
* a release status box

Other alterations include categorisation of most pages, and a re-organisation of page navigation. Enjoy. :P}}
