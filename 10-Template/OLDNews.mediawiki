Anders finally merged his sample_t changes and I got around to change the xmms_ipc_msg_t struct. Next big thing is the playlist update that should be comming soon. There will soon be a wrap-up meeting about the first DR release. Stay tuned.}}

{{Newsitem|date=10 February 2005 (2005-02-10) WST|author=[[Sham Chukoury]]|title=Wiki got a facelift|text=I've finished giving the wiki a bit of an overhaul, with gratuitous use of templates to implement all kinds of funky things like:
* This news section
* a new navigation bar
* a components status table
* a release status box

Other alterations include categorisation of most pages, and a re-organisation of page navigation. Enjoy. :P}}
