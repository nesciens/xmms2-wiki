I think that Daniel Geh's logo 3 is the best.

So far logo by Frank seems to be the best ones. Both for hi and low-color versions. It meets all requirements and looks really good.

I really like Jan's proposal. [[User:213.47.8.112|213.47.8.112]] 06:07, 28 Jun 2005 (PDT)

I haven't looked at all of them yet, but so far I like [[Henrik's proposal]] second one (the X2), [http://xaos.vexillium.org/pub/other/xmms2/xmms2.png another xmms2 logo made by xaos] the one on the left, and [http://wudika.de/~jan/xmms2/xmms2-color.png Jan's quick and dirty proposal]. Those are the three I like so far.
