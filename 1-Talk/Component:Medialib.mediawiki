= Compilations =

The problem of how to determine whether or not an album is a compilation and how to deal with it has actually been solved by amaroK already.

Each album has a "Compilation" flag. When you import your media, amaroK guesses whether or not the album is a compilation. All of the compilations are filed under an artist called "Various Artists" at the end of the media library.

Detecting various artists shouldn't be very difficult -- all we have to do is check if there's more than one artist on a single album (or, to be safe, more than 3 artists because people sometimes have typos in their "artist" tags).

A more advanced algorithm could even detect typos! Just strip extra whitespace from the artist field, then applying a SOUNDEX hash to each artist field. If the SOUNDEX values differ by a large enough number, then they're probably different artists.

Also, there are lot of free web services that let you look up album information (last.fm, amazon, google, msnmusic, yahoo, rs). A simpler solution could be to just write a python script that connects to one of those services to assign them Compilation status.

Hello, yes.

Cool things is that xmms2 detects various artists for albums tagged with musicbrainz information already. A compilation flag is set for each song in that case. But This should of course be expanded in the future. I like a simple as possible solution. Please take your implementation ideas to the mail list!
