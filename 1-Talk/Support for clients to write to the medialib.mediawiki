The second option definitely looks nicer to me too, and if there is a real need (which I can't really see happening, but you never know) we could introduce more "special" characters, i.e. *coverart_url or ^coverart_url

== 1 + 2 = 3 ==

If 1 + 2 could be combined like so:
_''property'' = server-set values and
''source''_''property'' = client-set values,
we could keep the current API and still use an infinite number of possible sources. Also it would be easy to block all write access to _''property'' values.
