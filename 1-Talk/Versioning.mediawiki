Based off "The not yet released ones are ofcourse up for discussion", here's my go:<br>
I was kinda hoping for Dr Doom.<br>
And I can't believe there's no e... Dr Evil!!!<br>
<br>
And uhhh, I guess that's all I can think of for now.<br>

Why not use the original codenames?
* "A big piece of garbage"
* "Birbot of IceCatraz"
* "That's Lobstertainment!"
* "Space Pilot 3000"
* "War is the H-Word"
* "A Bicyclops Built For Two"
* "Insane in the Mainframe"

Hey, those are actually pretty cute... [[User:VxJasonxV|VxJasonxV]] 12:14, 19 April 2006 (CEST)
