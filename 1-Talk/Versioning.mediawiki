Here are some suggestions for DrI... (from nano)

* Dr. Ironstein, from the Flight of the Amazon Queen adventure game (1995)
* Dr. Ignatio Mobius, from the Command & Conquer series. It is worth noting that Dr. Mobius is a very strange, almost Archimedes Plutonium-like character in his first incarnation as portrayed by Richard Smith, becoming considerably more staid and less mad scientist when later portrayed by Rene Auberjonois
* Dr. Ira Graves was a Human molecular cyberneticist. Graves was believed to be one of the finest scientific minds of his time and was a recipient of the Zee-Magnees Prize. Graves claimed to have been a mentor to Doctor Noonien Soong, suggesting that made him "grandfather" to Soong's android creation, Data.

Based off "The not yet released ones are ofcourse up for discussion", here's my go:<br>
I was kinda hoping for Dr Doom.<br>
And I can't believe there's no e... Dr Evil!!!<br>

And uhhh, I guess that's all I can think of for now.<br>

Why not use the original codenames?
* "A big piece of garbage"
* "Birbot of IceCatraz"
* "That's Lobstertainment!"
* "Space Pilot 3000"
* "War is the H-Word"
* "A Bicyclops Built For Two"
* "Insane in the Mainframe"

Hey, those are actually pretty cute... [[User:VxJasonxV|VxJasonxV]] 12:14, 19 April 2006 (CEST)
