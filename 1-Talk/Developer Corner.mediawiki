== What is a playlist ? ==
A playlist is an ordered collection of media data and their metadata.
A playlist should provide a way to:
* add track;
* remove track;
* remove multiple tracks;
* add multiple tracks;
* move a collection item after/before a specified item;
* move a collection item relatively to its position;
* clear the whole list;
* provide the current position in the list;
* set the current position in the list;
* provide the next collection item as specified by a scheme (none, repeat_all, repeat_one, shuffle, shuffle_repeat).
* save itself;
* add items from a playlist;
* sort the item as specified by a metadata field;
* reverse itself.

== How to (How we want to) implement a playlist ? ==
A playlist can be implemented as a doubly linked list of items.
An item is the association of a media track and it's metadata.
Here's the BNF:

 <playlist>::<item><playlist>|()
 <item>::<media track><meta data>
 <media track>::[ogg]|[mp3]|[ice]|[wave]|...
 <meta data>::[filename][trackname][author][albumname]...

To be continued ... time to sleep now -_-
