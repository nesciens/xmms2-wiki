It would be good to put somewhere user manuals. It would be fast easy and uptodate using Wikipedia page instead just manuals in sources.

I had problem with running xmms binnaries:

./xmms2: error while loading shared libraries: libxmmsclient.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Solution:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to libraries of xmms2>

Or use set instead of export. 

Path libraries of xmms2 is <instalation path>/lib
