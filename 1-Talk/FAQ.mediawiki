Isn't DBUS a better choice than a [http://git.xmms.se/?p=xmms2-devel.git;a=tree;h=82edc1f7fb700ae505455672fc6c1293bfd9dc2c;hb=708a7db5cedbd6f7d1559835079368d7e4134cf8;f=src/lib/xmmsipc proprietary] IPC protocol?

[[Wikipedia:Proprietary Software | Proprietary Software]]:
 Software which is privately owned or controlled is known as proprietary software.
 However, the extent to which proprietary rights can be claimed or maintained in
 relation to software is a matter of considerable controversy (see software patent debate).

Use the correct terminology. But of course D-BUS is better then some closed source protocol, luckily it doesn't matter for xmms2.
