=== DBUS ===

Isn't DBUS a better choice than a [http://git.xmms2.org/xmms2/xmms2-devel/tree/src/lib/xmmsipc proprietary] IPC protocol?

[[Wikipedia:Proprietary Software | Proprietary Software]]:
 Software which is privately owned or controlled is known as proprietary software.
 However, the extent to which proprietary rights can be claimed or maintained in
 relation to software is a matter of considerable controversy (see software patent debate).

Use the correct terminology. But of course D-BUS is better then some closed source protocol, luckily it doesn't matter for xmms2.
