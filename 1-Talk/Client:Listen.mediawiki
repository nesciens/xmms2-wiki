It is very sexy. It's really easy to install on Ubuntu (it's got a repository), and looks a lot like Rhythmbox.  Simple, well organised interface with CD-burning ability (haven't tried that yet)

Two improvements that I'd suggest though are:
* Stop it freezing when album cover and music info come up when starting a track.  Needs multi-threading?
* Organise music using library as it is now, but also add a tab that allows browsing by directory.  I spent ages sorting my music by directory, and now it's useless...

Other than that, it's great.
