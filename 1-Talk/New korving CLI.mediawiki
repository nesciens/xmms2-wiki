== Song Format ==
What will the new CLI do about that lame song format string that is all but ignored now? Get rid of it completely (does anyone ever change it?) or implement something more powerful, with conditionals?

I will still be present as a flag and/or config value. As for conditionals, feel free to hack :-)

== List Patterns ==

"If a pattern is given, contents are further filtered and only the matching media are displayed."

I'd like to see line item matching.

Examples:
* xmms2 list
** all items in playlist
* xmms2 list 10-
** all items starting from the 11th and onward to the end
* xmms2 list -20
** all items from the start until the 21st

and of course, literal ranging ( xmms2 list 10-20 = only the middle 10 items ).

It may be worth it to stop using 0 in playlists... [[User:VxJasonxV|VxJasonxV]] 04:30, 23 June 2007 (CEST)
