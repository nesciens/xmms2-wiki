I changed the IFS for <tt>mlib</tt> playlist operations and <tt>mlib search|searchadd</tt> to newline to get rid of the ^J which was showing up in the bash completions. I also changed <tt>mlib search|searchadd</tt> to use quotes around the search string so that spaces wouldn't break the completions.

so you'd do this:
<pre>
$ xmms2 mlib search artist="The 
The Doors
The Pogues
$ xmms2 mlib search artist="The Pogues"
</pre>

Good work :). I was wondering how to fix the file-with-spaces problem...<br />
Do you have any idea how to get list valid IDs for <b>jump</b>, <b>move</b> and <b>remove</b> commands ? This should be easy to fix.<br />
