== Ideas for Esperanza from users ==
* A shortcut to minimize the window to the left-top of your desktop. Because now you have to click on the icon to do that.
* When Esperanza is minimized to a bar, it's automaticly renamed to ''Esperanza <2>''. It would be a good idea to change the name back to Esperanza  after it's minimized to the bar.
* If the audio-file doesn't have an artist and title in it's meta-data, show the filename(with it's extension removed).
* If you click shuffle, don't shuffle the whole list, but instead jump to random places in the list, so that files from the same album are still together.
* Make Esperanza popup a small-dialog when you quit, with the choise to also close xmms2(xmms2 quit). Because it feels unintuitive to still hear music after you've closed the player.
