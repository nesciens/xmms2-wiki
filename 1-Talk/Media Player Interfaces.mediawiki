This is a difficult project by its nature as it's bridging projects with different philosophies and goals. It should be pretty obvious that there's going to be friction in creating some sort of DBus implementation. To alleviate the potential clashes between projects I originally suggested some sort of capabilities negotiation might be in order. However I, and others on the mailing lists, have come up with a set of ideas that I think we need to decide on first before proceeding to actually implement.

;KISS:
* just do basic playback functions (play, pause, stop, prev, next)
* limited functionality, but easy on clients and developers

;Limit the spec to similar media players:
* medialib players Amarok, XMMS2, and BMPx
* playlist players Amarok, XMMS2, BMPx, and VLC
* destroys potential for other players to implement the spec

;Capabilities negotiation:
* should only have a handful of sets of functionalities:
** playback
** playlist
** mediainfo
** medialib
* adds complication to the spec and clients have to deal with capabilities

;Common intersection object and individual objects
* make a common media player object where all the media player APIs overlap
* add objects that expose individual media player APIs
* begs the question of why one should bother with DBus instead of native API

First, we need to ask the question: "What is the purpose of this interface?"

From my point of view it should be an interface used by application that primarily isn't controlling the media player. Some examples:
* voip application that wants to automatically stop playback when there is an incomming call
* irc client script that announces current track
* "enqueue in mediaplayer" in contextmenu in filebrowser
* some alarm clock app that starts music playback with a specific track 5 minutes before the real alarm goes on.

With a common interface this kind of apps doesn't have to know about different media players, they just fire off some dbus messages to a standard place. Therefore the interface has to be as simple as possible.

Well, I think that a guaranteed basic set of capabilities should be something like:

* play, pause, stop, next, prev
* get a playlist entry's title/length, convenience RPCs for the current entry
* set playback volume, mute, adjust balance

Some players, e.g. Audacious, have some library-like qualities, such as Tuples, it may be better to split up medialib into something like:

* library/collections
* full-metadata

Also, DBus and my sanity do not get along, and I am sure it is the same way for others. A common library should be a must. I'd suggest MIT licencing for that.
