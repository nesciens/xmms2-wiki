Less is more. I suggest we try to combine these:

* XMMS2 should be a kick-ass music player 
* XMMS2 should facilitate playing and organizing of your music 

And these: (they are saying same thing, no?)

* XMMS2 will be the choice for audiophiles 
* XMMS2 users cares about music and are passionate about quality 

These are pretty similar too:

* X in XMMS2 is for cross platform 
* Embeddedfriendliness
