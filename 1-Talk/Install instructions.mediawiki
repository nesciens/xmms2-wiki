This is using SCons version v0.96.1.D001 it hasn't been tested on other SCons versions so please update the entry if this works properly for you.

This is the case with any PREFIX not just /usr; It might use more resources for /usr, but it can hang regardless of PREFIX, the problem is related to it scanning the contents of the prefix, which is whyit might use more resources for /usr vs /usr/local.

Maybe there should be a full list of dependencies listed...

==Problems with instalation and running==
I spend about an hour trying to fix this problem. It is very simple. 

If you get the following message from console while yoou try to run xmms2:
[code]
xmms2: error while loading shared libraries: libxmmsclient.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[/code]
you should specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to the xmms libraries.
[code]
#example for installed xmms on /usr/local/xmms
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/xmms/lib
[/code]
You may need to use 'set' instead of 'export'.
