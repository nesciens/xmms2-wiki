= Proposal for definitions of nomenclature, to avoid confusion =

; Property
: A property is a field-key combination used to specify something. E.g. the title of a song.

; Media
: Media are the atomic entities that are part of the media library, typically a song or stream.
: Media can have properties, such as titles, durations, etc.

; Mediaset
: A mediaset is an abstract structure containing a number of media. I.e. it is a container for media.
: A mediaset is the result/output of an operator

; Operand
: An operand is a mediaset used by an operator.

; Attribute
: An attribute is a field-key combination, modifying the behaviour of an operator.
: An attribute can be called a 'property' of an operator

; Operator
: An operator is the concrete representation of an operation. 
: An operator always results in a mediaset.
: An operator can have operands (if applicable).
: An operator can have attributes.

; DAG
: Operators can have operands. Operands are mediasets. Mediasets are results of operators. Hence: Operators can use results from other operators. So: operators can be organized in a tree structure. This structure is also called a DAG ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph Directed Acyclic Graph]). In this DAG the operators are the nodes or vertices and the mediasets that are transferred between these nodes are the edges.

; Medialist
: A medialist is an ordered mediaset.

; Collection
: Collection is identical to mediaset.

* A property (resp. attribute) is a field-key combination '''attached to a media (resp. collection operator)'''  to specify [...]
* ''An attribute can be called a 'property' of an operator''
Confusing, better separate the terms cleanly.

* ''An operand is a mediaset used '''as the input of''' an operator.''

* ''An operator always results in a mediaset.''
Confusing, it does not intuitively imply that some operators produce medialists.

* ''So: operators can be organized in a '''tree''' structure.''
'''graph''' structure (see examples)

* ''Collection is identical to mediaset.''
''identical'' is confusing I think. See [[Collections_Concept#Formal_definition_of_a_Collection]].


Good work!
