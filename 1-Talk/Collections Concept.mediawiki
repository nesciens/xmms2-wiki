= Proposal for definitions of nomenclature, to avoid confusion =

; Property
: A field-key combination used to specify something. E.g. the title of a song.

; Media
: An atomic entity that is part of the media library, typically a song or stream.
: Media can have properties, such as titles, durations, etc.

; Mediaset
: A mediaset is an abstract structure containing a number of media. I.e. it is a container for media.
: A mediaset is the result/output of an operator

; Operand
: A mediaset used by an operator.

; Attribute
: An attribute is a field-key combination, modifying the behaviour of an operator.
: An attribute can also be called a 'property' of an operator

; Operator
: An operator is the concrete representation of an operation. 
: An operator always results in a mediaset.
: An operator can have operands (if applicable).
: An operator can have attributes.

; DAG
: Operators can have operands. Operands are mediasets. Mediasets are results of operators. Because of this operators can be organized in a tree structure. This structure is also called a DAG ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph Directed Acyclic Graph]). In this DAG the operators are the nodes or vertices and the mediasets that are transferred between them are the edges.

; Medialist
: A medialist is an ordered mediaset.

; Collection
: Collection is identical mediaset.
