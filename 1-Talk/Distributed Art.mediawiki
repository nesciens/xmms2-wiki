I've got a few questions about the current proposal:
# Wouldn't it be better to have a P2P model, instead of needing a central server? Some disadvantages of having a central server: someone has to host and maintain it, server becomes a big, juicy target for possible litigation (legal enforcement of copyright violation re: album art is unclear, AFAIK).
# I have doubts about the security of pushing python dicts across the net - pushing them across unix sockets or on a trusted network is fine, but the internet is a wild, wild place.
# Multiple image support can be good, since the same album can be released in different countries with different cover art.

Responses:
# We could host it as a named service on tor, so that would keep us safe from being located, etc. We might implement it as p2p later too.
