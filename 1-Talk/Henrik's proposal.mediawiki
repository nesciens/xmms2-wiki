 08:47 <eleusis> too bad he got the XMMS acronym wrong :P
 08:47 <eleusis> for xmms2
 09:03 <tru> do we want to follow up on henriks logotype? or do we think it sucks? :)
 09:03 <eleusis> i think it's an interesting idea
 09:04 <eleusis> but it doesn't seem to have much to do with music :P
 09:10 <anders> I think it should be in latin.. Something like: "sigillum player musicum 
                platformii crossum"
 09:14 <tru> I think the idea is good. but I think the X2 i the middle should be a pattern 
             that you could use without the frame. 
 09:16 <anders> Yes, I was just about to point that out.
 09:16 <anders> That it's a bit to "bloated" to be able to do a very small icon..
