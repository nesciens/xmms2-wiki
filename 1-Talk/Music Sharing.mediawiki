Could the author of this suggestion please identify him/herself? ;) If i recall correctly, music/metadata sharing and DAAP were ideas raised by ''shank'' - the MPD (Music Player Daemon) developer - in our IRC channel, a while ago. I believe he also suggested he'd like to join the XMMS2 team to further develop these ideas, after releasing MPD v1. As for ''that one company and their ever so popular music software'', I assume you're referring to Apple and iTunes? Please try to be as clear as possible when providing suggestions, etc - we're trying to develop software here, not read minds and guess assumptions. ;)
