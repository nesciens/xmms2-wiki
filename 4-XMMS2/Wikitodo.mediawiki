This is a to-do list for the wiki, not XMMS2 itself. The [http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se bug tracker] is the to-do list for XMMS2 - see [[Reporting bugs]] for details. If you're new to this wiki, see the [[XMMS2:Wikiguidelines | wiki guidelines]].

* (continuously) improve navigation around the wiki.
* make and maintain a list of templates used.
* [[Project Status]] is very poorly maintained. It probably needs to be replaced with something that is semi-automatically updated - possibly with integration with mantis.
* Try and improve information about tools and dependencies needed to build, install and/or package XMMS2. Possibly provide distro-specific instructions about installing tools and dependencies.
* Have a packaging guidelines page?
