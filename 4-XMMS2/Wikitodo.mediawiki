This is a to-do list for the wiki, not XMMS2 itself. The [http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se bug tracker] is the to-do list for XMMS2 - see [[Reporting bugs]] for details. If you're new to this wiki, see the [[XMMS2:Wikiguidelines | wiki guidelines]].

* (continuously) improve navigation around the wiki.
* make and maintain a list of templates used.
* [[Project Status]] is very poorly maintained. It probably needs to be replaced with something that is semi-automatically updated - possibly with integration with mantis.
* Try and improve information about tools and dependencies needed to build, install and/or package XMMS2. Possibly provide distro-specific instructions about installing tools and dependencies.
* Have a packaging guidelines page?
* Maybe add a link to http://www.frappr.com/xmms2 somewhere
* Pimp the wiki! MediaWiki doesn't have to look like this. The [http://mono-project.com/Main_Page Mono Project] is a perfect example.
* The log filename format has changed, as well as the whole process of logging messages from the daemon - revise pages mentioning log filenames and those with sections about data in the log files in general.
** Pages mentioning log filenames: [[Reporting bugs]]
** Pages with sections about data in log files: ''None?''
* [[Using the application]] could probably explain a bit more about how to use ''xmms2-launcher''
* [[Support for clients to write to the medialib]] needs to be reviewed
* [[Generic properties policy]] should really be expanded.
* [[Developer Corner#Ideas | Developer ideas]] needs to be restructured to show the status of such ideas - proposals, (in discussion?), work in progress, implemented/completed.
** Possibly hook this into "if you want to propose a feature for xmms2" or something
** Possibly modify [[XMMS2 Development Process]] -> add developer idea, discussion, file bug (more formal) -> ??? -> implement -> close bug
* Mention http://test.xmms.se somewhere
** maybe [[Testing]]
