Guidelines for XMMS2 wiki:

* Most pages should have the [[Template:Navbar | navbar template]] at the top.
* Use [[Special:Categories | categories]] to help organise pages. On the XMMS2 wiki, category tags go at the bottom of every article.
* Edits that only correct spelling errors or minor grammatical errors should be set as 'minor edits'.
* Try to provide an informative edit summary for every edit if possible.
* Keep discussions on Talk pages.
* For questions about XMMS2, try to [[About#Contact_info | contact]] the team instead of putting up questions on the wiki.
